INFOSYS:
tell me about yourself
what is docker, why we use them------------->docker is a open source contanarization tool which creates advanced level of virtualization. it is designed to facilitate the application developemt inside software contaniners. we use docker as it is lightweight,less cost,we can resue resources and we can send the images to any other teams so that their application will run efficiently. it has only 1 os which runs contianers, we can easily build and run the containers
why you used github----------------->github is used to store the data where different teams collaborate with each other and developed diifreent versions of code. we used this because various developers can easily identify the changed code and run them in their local machines and test them.
how to create dockerfile and components-------------->dockerfile is a file which contains a set of instructions that are used to create the docker image, there are various components of docker file such as from, cmd, label, run, entrypoint, copy, add etc
how to write playbook for loops-------->playbooks are uually written in yaml file. below is the playbooks for loop 
- hosts: keshavi
  become: yes
  user: kyatham
  connection: ssh
  tasks: 
  - name: "add users"
    user:
      name: {{items.username}}
      state: present
      groups: sudo
      append: yes
      password: "{{items.password}}"
      with_items:
        - { username: 'keshavi', password: 'keshavi' }
        - { username: 'keshavi1', password: 'keshavi1' }
what was there before docker ---------------> we have vmware before docker. its a virtualization technology where many operating systems runs on single physical machine. but docker is more lightweight.
anything you have done on your own
why you have installed tomcat
what are maven dependencies
jenkins architecture ----------> we have 3 components. jenkins master/server, jenkins agent nodes/clouds, jenkins webinterface. on master we have all the configurations such as scheduling job,plugins,users and monitoring etc. on jenkins agent nodes(linux,windows) clouds(docker,k8) this tells us on which the pipeline should run. web intrace gives us the visual representation of pipelines.
2 types of pipelines---------------->declarative & scripted pipeline. declarative stress on what to do rather than how to do. declarative is easy to read.
have you done any automation using chef cookbooks
write code for declarative
types of aws ec2-instance
servcie now ticketing tools
daily routine
have you done only support part
automation have you done
jenkins job creation
issues you faced when deploying ci/cd pipeline
--------------------------------------------------------------
what you will do when containers are stopped-------->id check if it was stopped manualy, and then start the containers using docker start contnername command to start them, notify the administrators about stopped container. ill check if there is any major impact due to this

what is cd
for example lets say that 2 dev are writing code and changing same file in 2 diff branches. how will you resolve this issue. ----->git conflict
can we resolve the conflict without taking help of other developer------------->no, we just have to connect with other dev and ask what needs to be changed
git workflow--------->workspace, staging area and local repo
maven build lifecycle
maven goals
what you meant by human intevention in continous deployment and how does it work
i have one job and have some files in github. in that i dont want 1 file to get executed when my jenkins jobs run. how will you solve this issue--------->by using .gitignore or using conditional statemnt in jenkinsfile
if i want to execute one particular command in dockerfile then how will you do that and build it------->RUN command
how you got into devops role and want is your interest
what does stryker do
how to create a job in jenkins
how to trigger jobs in jenkins------->manualy, using grovvy when building pipe, using cron job

diff between fetch and pull---------->in fetch file is not changed in local repo but in pul file is changed in local repo

---------------------------------------------------------------
YESDE:
grep use in linux -----------> same like filter in windows
can we use grep for finding processes ------> yes, ps -ef | grep <pid>
git squash------>combining multiple commit to single commit. git merge --squash
how to go inside containers-------> docker attach kesh
why we use /bin/bash in containers---------> to run the containers in interactive mode
if my container got crashed then how can we get them back--->volumes
docker networks-------->when we want to link multiple contianer we use this. 
why we use security groups---->acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with.
why we use autoscaling---->we use this when you want to increase the vm's when the resource utilizatio exceeds the point 
how to block users in aws
which jobs you have worked on in jenkins
are you using maven as backup only?
what is git rebase--------->when we want to transfer the old branch to completly new branch
have you worked on disaster recovery modes-->master and slave in jenkins
example i have to create list of users in morning and want to delete them at night. for this what is your approach in ansible---------->it is not ideal method using anisble but we can do it using playbooks. state would be present in morning and absent in eveng

---------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOUDFRONT:

where is inventory path in ansible?-----------/etc/ansible/hosts
i have 5 nodes and want to execute some commands. so do i have to write 5 diff playbooks for that?----------you can create a grp and in playbook write hosts: grpname
have you worked on roles, if yes what are roles and what is the thing you have worked on it
as ansible is agentless tool how it will communicate with nodes?---------by using ssh. we have to establish ss-keygen and ssh-copy-id kesh@ip

can we change ansible.cfg path? -------yes..better to change it in current working directory. if not there it checks in users home dir. 
if not there also it goes to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file
what is vpc?------------virtual private cloud. it enables you to launch aws resources into virtual nkt that you have defined. it allows you to isolate your nkt with other nkts in cloud
difference btwen private and public subnet?---------private means it is not accesible through internet but only through vpc. public means accessible through internet.
what is cloud formation?-----------its an aws service it will let you build entire app from strach
difference between load balancer and auto scaling in aws?----------scaleup and down ec2 instnaces whenevr needed. load balancer distributes incomming data accros multiple ec2 
or containers 
what are elastic ip's?-----------means in normal public ips when ever you start or stop the services public ip gets changed(dynamic). but in elastic ip is fixed(static) and
can be attached to instances.
what is s3 bucket?-------------object simple storage service which stores data as objects in buckets. object contains file and metadata about the files
what is ec2 in aws?-------ec2 is an iaas service. it is a virtual machine which is hosted on cloud.we can run any kind of instances
difference between cloudtrial and cloud watch?---------watch gives you the visibility of performance and healthcheck of resources and applications. 
while trial is an API cal recording and log monitoring web service

INFOSYS PROJECT INTERVIEWS:

there is a logic app and we are changing them from portal. i need to maintain the versions of changes in azure how?Open your logic app in the Azure portal.In the left-hand menu, under Development Tools, click Versions.
there is a fucntionapp and azure api. i want to access the fucntionapp using azure api but not from functionapp url how?
what are access policies?----------->where we define the criteria to grant permisssion for various apps,
what are the things need to deploy fucntionapp
do we need storage account to deploy fctn app
do you have any idea on bicep
how can we make a ctcn between 2 resouces like keyvault and storage account or fucntionapp
if we deploy 5 fcuntionapp do we need 5 keys?
things to know about azure api
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCENTURE:

how to create a build pipeline if you dont have any yaml code and what are the steps included in build pipeline
can we do testing in build piepline------>yes we can
which is better to deploy web app  is it vm or app service?-------->app service as it is cheap and robust but if you want full control of your application then go for vm
which is better to deploy web app  is it container or app service?---------->If you want more control over the underlying infrastructure, then Azure Container Apps is a better choice. If you want to focus on developing your application and not worry about the underlying infrastructure, then Azure App Service is a better choice.
what is the difference between variable grp and pipleine varble------>piplne vars are used for specific pipleins but variable grp are like centralized which will be used accros the project i.e., diff pipelines
what are the azure policies?---------------->Think of code review as ensuring the quality and functionality of the recipe (code) itself. Azure Policy acts like a health inspector during deployment, verifying if the prepared dish (deployed resource) meets safety and hygiene standards (policy rules).
lets say if developers write the code and wants to raise a pr. it should got through reviwers adn merge it. where do we declare the azure policy?------------------>You can define Azure Policy definitions that specify rules and conditions for your Azure resources.During deployment, the pipeline checks if the newly deployed resources comply with these policies.
If any policy violation occurs (e.g., resource missing a required tag, security misconfiguration), the deployment might be blocked, or remediation actions might be taken depending on the policy configuration.
