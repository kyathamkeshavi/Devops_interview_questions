INFOSYS:

tell me about yourself ----------------->Hello, I’m keshavi, and I am from hyd. I completed my bachelor's degree in 2018 from bvrith. i have 6 years of exp, in intial stages of my career i worked as a sql dba and from past 3 years im working as a devops engineer. my first compnay is tcs and now im working in infosys. With three years of experience as a DevOps engineer, I have developed a strong expertise in various technologies such as Git, GitHub, Azure,jenkins,ansible and Terraform. 
In my role, I drive collaboration between development and operations teams, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in our workflows. I specialize in automating processes, managing infrastructure, and successfully deploying applications. I am committed to delivering high-quality results and enhancing operational performance.
what is docker, why we use them ------------->docker is a open source contanarization tool which creates advanced level of virtualization that is containerization. it is designed to facilitate the application developemt inside software contaniners. we use docker as it is lightweight,less cost,we can resue resources and we can send the images to any other teams so that their application will run efficiently. it has only 1 os which runs contianers, we can easily build and run the containers
why you used github----------------->github is used to store the data where different teams collaborate with each other and developed diifreent versions of code. we used this because various developers can easily identify the changed code and run them in their local machines and test them.
how to create dockerfile and components-------------->dockerfile is a file which contains a set of instructions that are used to create the docker image, there are various components of docker file such as from, cmd, label, run, entrypoint, copy, add etc
how to write playbook for loops-------->playbooks are uually written in yaml file. below is the playbooks for loop 
- hosts: keshavi
  become: yes
  user: kyatham
  connection: ssh
  tasks: 
  - name: "add users"
    user:
      name: {{items.username}}
      state: present
      groups: sudo
      append: yes
      password: "{{items.password}}"
      with_items:
        - { username: 'keshavi', password: 'keshavi' }
        - { username: 'keshavi1', password: 'keshavi1' }
what was there before docker ---------------> we have vmware before docker. its a virtualization technology where many operating systems runs on single physical machine.in vmware every vm has operating system and resources like cpu,ram,rom are not shared. whereas in docker resources are shared and it is more lightweight.
anything you have done on your own
why you have installed tomcat
what are maven dependencies
jenkins architecture ----------> we have 3 components. jenkins master/server, jenkins agent nodes/clouds, jenkins webinterface. on master we have all the configurations such as scheduling job,plugins,users and monitoring etc. on jenkins agent nodes(linux,windows) clouds(docker,k8) this tells us on which the pipeline should run. web intrace gives us the visual representation of pipelines.
2 types of pipelines---------------->declarative & scripted pipeline. declarative stress on what to do rather than how to do. declarative is easy to read.
have you done any automation using chef cookbooks
write code for declarative
types of aws ec2-instance----------->general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, accelerating computing, and high-performance computing (HPC) optimized
servcie now ticketing tools
daily routine
have you done only support part
automation have you done
jenkins job creation
issues you faced when deploying ci/cd pipeline
--------------------------------------------------------------
what you will do when containers are stopped-------->id check the container logs, and then restart the containers using docker start contnername command to start them,check the resource usage on container using docker stats <cont> command, notify the administrators about stopped container. ill check if there is any major impact due to this
what is the storage you used in aws---------->s3(simple storage service)
how to create jenkins job
what is the storage you have worked on in aws
what is the port range you have worked in aws
what is instance have you worked in aws
---------------------------------------------------------------
RELIANCE:
what is issue we faced before ci and we did overcome after ci ---------->Merging code from multiple developers was often complex and time-consuming. This led to integration issues and delays. Manual testing was slow and prone to errors, making it difficult to ensure code quality. Frequent build failures disrupted the development process and delayed releases. Merge conflicts were common when multiple developers worked on the same codebase simultaneously. but after ci, CI encourages small, frequent commits and uses branching strategies to minimize conflicts. CI tools automatically integrate code changes, reducing the complexity and time required for manual merges. Using containerization technologies like Docker, CI ensures consistent across varios environments
what is cd------------>continous deliver or deployment. it means code is deployed on the production environment. 
for example lets say that 2 dev are writing code and changing same file in 2 diff branches. how will you resolve this issue. ----->merge conflict
can we resolve the conflict without taking help of other developer------------->no, we just have to connect with other dev and ask what needs to be changed
git workflow--------->workspace, staging area and local repo
maven build lifecycle
maven goals
what you meant by human intevention in continous deployment and how does it work
i have one job and have some files in github. in that i dont want 1 file to get executed when my jenkins jobs run. how will you solve this issue--------->by using .gitignore or using conditional statemnt in jenkinsfile
if i want to execute one particular command in dockerfile then how will you do that and build it------->RUN command
how you got into devops role and want is your interest
what does stryker do
how to create a job in jenkins
how to trigger jobs in jenkins------->manualy, using grovvy when building pipe, using cron job
phases in maven
do we need internet to download dependencies in maven------->yes, However, there are a few scenarios where you might not need an internet connection:
Local Repository: If you have already downloaded the required dependencies and they are stored in your local Maven repository, you can build your project without an internet connection.
You can manually download dependencies and install them into your local repository.   
Offline Mode: Some Maven tools and plugins allow you to work in offline mode, but this is limited to projects that only rely on dependencies already present in your local repository. This mode is not suitable for most real-world projects, as it restricts access to new dependencies or updates.
diff between fetch and pull---------->in fetch file is not changed in local repo but in pul file is changed in local repo

---------------------------------------------------------------
YESDE:
grep use in linux -----------> The grep command in Linux is a powerful tool used for searching text. grep "search_term" filename. same like filter in windows
can we use grep for finding processes ------> yes, ps -ef | grep <pid>
git squash------>combining multiple commit to single commit. git merge --squash
how to go inside containers-------> docker attach kesh or docker exec -it cont /bin/bash
why we use /bin/bash in containers---------> to run the containers in interactive mode. which is useful for debugging and running commands interactively within the container. This is especially helpful during development and troubleshooting
if my container got crashed then how can we get them back----------->First, check the logs to understand why the container crashed: docker logs <container_id>, Try restarting the container: docker start <container_id>, If your container uses volumes to store data, you can recover the data from these volumes even if the container itself is not running:
docker cp <container_id>:/path/to/data /local/path
docker networks-------->when we want to link multiple contianer we use this. 
why we use security groups---->acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with.
why we use autoscaling---->we use this when you want to increase the vm's when the resource utilizatio exceeds the point 
how to block users in aws
which jobs you have worked on in jenkins
are you using maven as backup only?
what is git rebase--------->when we want to transfer the old branch to completly new branch
have you worked on disaster recovery modes---------------->master and slave in jenkins
example i have to create list of users in morning and want to delete them at night. for this what is your approach in ansible---------->it is not ideal method using anisble but we can do it using playbooks. state would be present in morning and absent in eveng
how to install a service in ansible. what are the methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOUDFRONT:

have you created any ci/cd pipelines
how to delete docker image------------>docker rmi kesh
how to get into existing container---------->docker exec -it kesh /bin/bash or docker attach kesh
what is the diff between autoscaling and load balancer and when we use it------>A load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.   
where is inventory path in ansible?-----------/etc/ansible/hosts
i have 5 nodes and want to execute some commands. so do i have to write 5 diff playbooks for that?----------No, you don't need to write five different playbooks to execute commands on five nodes. You can define all your nodes in a single inventory file and use one playbook to target them
have you worked on roles, if yes what are roles and what is the thing you have worked on it
as ansible is agentless tool how it will communicate with nodes?---------by using ssh. we have to establish ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id kesh@ip
how to execute commands in linux?---------by using chmod
what is command for changing owner of file in linux------------>chown 644 keshavi
command to use free space in linux---------->free -m, df, du
command to know about cpu usage in linux---------->top, htop, vmstat
what things you take care when launching ec2-instances
can we change ansible.cfg path? -------yes..better to change it in current working directory. if not there it checks in users home dir. 
if not there also it goes to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file
what is vpc?------------virtual private cloud. it enables you to launch aws resources into virtual nkt that you have defined. it allows you to isolate your nkt with other nkts in cloud
difference btwen private and public subnet?---------private means it is not accesible through internet but only through vpc. public means accessible through internet.
what is cloud formation?-----------its an aws service it will let you build entire app from strach
difference between load balancer and auto scaling in aws?----------scaleup and down ec2 instnaces whenevr needed. load balancer distributes incomming data accros multiple ec2 
or containers 
what are elastic ip's?-----------means in normal public ips when ever you start or stop the services public ip gets changed(dynamic). but in elastic ip is fixed(static) and
can be attached to instances.
what is s3 bucket?-------------object simple storage service which stores data as objects in buckets. object contains file and metadata about the files
what is ec2 in aws?-------ec2 is an iaas service. it is a virtual machine which is hosted on cloud.we can run any kind of instances
difference between cloudtrial and cloud watch?---------watch gives you the visibility of performance and healthcheck of resources and applications. 
while trial is an API cal recording and log monitoring web service

---------------------------------------------------------------
SREETECH:
why are you looking for other job, if you already have an offer letter
what playbooks have you written in ansible
why we use handler----------->we use this if to notify other ther services to start
why we use loops in ansible--------------> when we want to execute same thing n number of times then we use loops. for eg if we want to create few users then instead of writing diff playbooks we can mention in 1 playbook about the users and execute it. by this the users will be created
and what are required when writing loops---------->host,user details,connection, task
how do you know how much memory is there in linux-------->free-m, top, vtop,vmstat
what is the default number of file in linux--------->644

ACS:
tell me about your projects and roles and resposnsibles in your project
what language is used in your project------------------------>.net
how many pipelines are there in jenkins in your peoject------------->many pipelines according to environment. declarative and scipted pipleine
why do you use ansible in your project and what is the use even though we can run docker images directly------------------>in our project docker is used to deply the containers and store the image. but ansible is used to install the necessary package, manages the configuration even before the container is deployed. it ensures that the configuration is consistant accros all the environment
what is difference between chef and ansible----------->both are configuration management tools but ansible uses pull machanism but chef uses push mechanism
what is command to check syntax of ansible playbook------->ansible-playboon kesh.yml --check
how to copy files in ansible for different nodes in single playbook--------->ansible kesh -b -m copy "src= ,dest="
why we use roles in ansible-------------->when we need to use set of task repeatedly. by using roles we can breakdown our playbook into smaller components and resuse them. if we organize the tasks into roles it would be easy to read and maintain them. diff teams can create diff roles without interfering in each others work
what is ansible galaxy-------->its an gui. it is like a repo which has vast collection of ansible roles and collections. it allows users to share their own roles and collections. we can share and download whatever it is needed.
what are types of projects you created in jenkins------------------->pipeline projects
;how do you execute different scripts on different servers by using jenkins freestyle projects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFOSYS PROJECT INTERVIEWS:

there is a logic app and we are changing them from portal. i need to maintain the versions of changes in azure how?--------------->Open your logic app in the Azure portal.In the left-hand menu, under Development Tools, click Versions.
there is a fucntionapp and azure api. i want to access the fucntionapp using azure api but not from functionapp url how?
what are access policies?----------->where we define the criteria to grant permisssion for various apps,
what are the things need to deploy fucntionapp------------->subscription, resource grp, app servive plan, function app name config, storage acnt
do we need storage account to deploy fctn app----->yes
do you have any idea on bicep
how can we make a ctcn between 2 resouces like keyvault and storage account or fucntionapp-------->to securely store and retrieve secrets, such as connection strings, API keys, or certificates
if we deploy 5 fcuntionapp do we need 5 keys?-------------------->, you can manage access to your functions using a combination of these keys without needing a separate key for each Function App. If you want to simplify management, you can use host keys or even a master key, depending on your security requirements.
things to know about azure api
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCENTURE:

how to create a build pipeline if you dont have any yaml code and what are the steps included in build pipeline---------------->Creating a build pipeline without using YAML code can be done through the classic editor in Azure DevOps.
can we do testing in build piepline------>yes we can
which is better to deploy web app  is it vm or app service?-------->app service as it is cheap and robust but if you want full control of your application then go for vm
which is better to deploy web app  is it container or app service?---------->If you want more control over the underlying infrastructure, then Azure Container Apps is a better choice. If you want to focus on developing your application and not worry about the underlying infrastructure, then Azure App Service is a better choice.
what is the difference between variable grp and pipleine varble------>piplne vars are used for specific pipleins but variable grp are like centralized which will be used accros the project i.e., diff pipelines
what are the azure policies?----------------> Azure Policy acts like a health inspector during deployment, verifying if the deployed resource meets safety standards (policy rules).
lets say if developers write the code and wants to raise a pr. it should got through reviwers adn merge it. where do we declare the azure policy?------------------>You can define Azure Policy definitions that specify rules and conditions for your Azure resources.During deployment, the pipeline checks if the newly deployed resources comply with these policies.
If any policy violation occurs (e.g., resource missing a required tag, security misconfiguration), the deployment might be blocked, or remediation actions might be taken depending on the policy configuration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZENSAR:

tell me about yourslef
tell me end to end implementation in your project and what are the complex things you faced
how you used to deploy the resources. is it directly on prod or non prod?---------->dev, qa and production
what are testing you used to do before deploying the services.-------------------->Ensures that the entire application flow works as expected from start to finish, Validates that the software functions according to the specified requirements, security code reviews, Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures that the application is secure from threats,  ensure the software is stable, secure, and performs as expected.
what are the branching startegies you used in your project?------------>we have main and feature branches. we take the code from main barnch and create anew branch. once the testing and everything is done we will merge it to main branch
how do you integrate git with azure repos ----------------------->install git in local, go to ado and create a new repo and clone the repo in your local. make the changes in your system and add commit and push them to azure repo.
what do you mean by system integration-------------->System integration is the process of combining different subsystems or components into a single, cohesive system that functions as a unified whole. This involves ensuring that the various components work together seamlessly to achieve the desired functionality and performance.
have you worked on terraform if yes how did you implement it
what kind of work have you done in terraform
what are terraform provisoners------------>Terraform provisioners are components that allow you to execute scripts or commands on local or remote machines as part of the resource creation or destruction process. They enable additional configuration and setup tasks that can't be accomplished with Terraform's declarative syntax alone. Here’s a detailed look at provisioners: Local-Exec Provisioner, remote-exec, File Provisioner
on which environment did you tested the terraform
what do you mean by remote state in terraform--------------->In Terraform, remote state refers to storing the state file in a remote location instead of locally on your machine. The state file is a critical component that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure, allowing Terraform to manage and apply changes accurately
what are the security implementation you have done in your projects---------------->Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have the minimum necessary permissions, Managed encryption keys securely using services like Azure Key Vault, Configured virtual private networks (VPNs) and network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
you have mentioned the efficiency is increased by 30% in your resume. can you describe about it--------------------->Implemented automated unit and integration tests using a CI/CD pipeline, Reduced configuration errors and deployment time by automating infrastructure provisioning. wrote the arm template for creating restricting the user by creating the rbac role. previosuly we used to have classic pipeline for release, we created yaml pipeline so that both build and release pipelines can be done at once.
have you worked on azure monitoring tools?
how do you recommend the service for the client--------------------> Understand the Client's Needs, Research and evaluate different services that could meet the client's needs.
Consider factors such as cost, features, scalability, and support, Customize your recommendation to align with the client's specific needs and preferences.
are you able to work in night shift
did you do any certifications
why you are looking for job change?---------------------->I'm always eager to learn and take on new opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in different ways and contribute to exciting projects.

did you maintain the servcies once it is deployed?
how much do you rate in powershell, azure and devops
how does devops helps in the industry
core prospects or fucntionalities in devops
what is the pull request------------>pull request is nothing but combining the code that is there in our branch with the other branch. usualy we create pr when we want to merge our code to main/master in the remote barnch.
what is service connection--------------->it is used to make a connection between azure services, or external services like docker, github etc with azure pipelines.
what are the tyoes of pipelines in azure devops and explain them------------>classic and yaml pipeline
in your projects which pipeline you used--------> we used yaml for build pipeline and classic for release
if you are using the yaml pipeline then what will be the task type for dot net application----------->UseDotNet@2
how do you test and deploy the services------------->first of all we will write the code and then push it to remote repository. once our code is there in remote repo we will trigger the pipelines and check if everything is successful or not in the logs
when you want to add new service in the existing pipeline how do you do it------------>in classic pipeline we can add a new stage or create a new task in the existing stage
what is the difference between complte mode and incremental mode in arm template----------->complete mode: If your resource group initially contains Resource A, Resource B, and Resource C, and your template specifies only Resource A and Resource B, Resource C will be deleted after deployment. incremental mode: If your resource group initially contains Resource A, Resource B, and Resource C, and your template specifies Resource A, Resource B, and Resource D, after deployment, the resource group will contain Resource A, Resource B, Resource C, and Resource D
what are build and release task you are using. give me the task names in yaml file
which powershell command do you use for deploying arm template---------------->New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "ExampleResourceGroup" -TemplateFile "C:\MyTemplates\azuredeploy.json" -TemplateParameterFile "C:\MyTemplates\azuredeploy.parameters.json"
using terraform how to deploy the infrastructure
what is the state file------------------->A state file is a JSON file that stores metadata about the resources managed by your IaC tool. It includes details such as resource IDs, configurations, and dependencies1. It helps the IaC tool understand the current state of your infrastructure, enabling it to determine what changes need to be applied during subsequent deployments

where are your artifacts stored----------------->y default, pipeline artifacts are stored in the $(Pipeline.Workspace) directory.
can we change the storage path when we are generating the artifact. means i want to store my artifact in custom path how to do it---------->You can specify the custom path in your pipeline YAML file using the publish keyword or the PublishPipelineArtifact task.
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/custom/path'
    artifact: 'my-artifact'

Why we are starting with from in Docker file. Why we are using it------------>The FROM command initializes a new build stage and sets the base image for subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile. It essentially tells Docker which existing image to use as a starting point, which can be any valid image from Docker Hub or a custom image from a local repository
What are the resources you worked on till now--------------------->kv, storage acount, msi, app service, traffic manager
Why we are using traffic manager--------------->we use traffic manager to distribute the tarffic accross global regions

what is devops and why we use it-----------> DevOps is a set of practice that aim to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on automating and integrating the processes between software development and IT teams, enabling them to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably
you have written pull and push configuration in version control. explain about this
how did you integrate git to azure
how do you list the processor in linux ----------->top, vtop, ps -ef|grep name
how to give sudo permission to user in ansible--------------------->- name: "username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | lineinfile path=/etc/sudoers state=present regexp='^username ALL=' validate='visudo -cf %s'
what is the path of inventory in ansible---------------> /etc/ansible/hosts
i need a pipeline where it has to run every morning and it should delete by eveng---------------->use cron in yaml file
i have a sql image, run the sql image and create the container and set the use password for it in docker--------------->docker pull image, docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=your_strong_password" -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:latest. here in this -d is detached mode. 
write a dockerfile which create the subnet and deploy it
syntax for yaml file-------------->trigger: Specifies which branches will trigger the pipeline.
pool: Defines the agent pool to use.
variables: Sets variables for the pipeline.
stages: Defines stages in the pipeline, each containing jobs and steps.
stage
jobs
job
steps
task
how to establish a connection between 2 nodes in ansible---------------->To establish a connection between two nodes in Ansible, you typically use SSH. create ssh keys, copy ssh keys to nodes, update inventory files. check the connection by pinging
write a playbook which installs the sql server------------->- name: Install SQL Server
  hosts: myservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
      - name: Install SQL Server
      apt:
        name: mssql-server
        state: present
have you worked on front door------------------------->Azure Front Door is a powerful service designed to enhance the performance, scalability, and security of your web applications. It acts as a global content delivery network (CDN) and load balancer, Distributes traffic across multiple regions to ensure high availability and reliability.

do you have any idea on github actions---------------------->GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate your software development workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying code.
why we need ci and its usage------------------->Early Detection of Issues. as the code is integrated multiple times we can easily detect and resolve issues. it improves code quality as the new code doesnot break the existing functinality. we will also get fatser feedback for the devlopers. it also increase the collaboration between dif teams and reducing the merge conflicts
compliance you have done on your project---------------------->Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign permissions based on user roles to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data.Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) solutions like Azure AD to manage access controls. Code Reviews: Regular code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
you mentioned u increased efficiency in resume explain about it---------------->previously in the project we used to have yml pipeline only for build and for release we used to have classic pipeline. but now we are using yml file which contains both build n deploy stages. and also previously we used to have different files for prod int dev. but now we segregated all the files in a single file and given condition that if the previous env is succesful then it should start the next env. apart from this we are now using terraform for creatign infra and ansible to configure the infra in one go
tell us the overview of your project--------------->tell them about ci/cd pipleine 
what have u done in your project and your experince------------->tell the about your daily activities
any qstns u have for us-------------------->What tools and technologies does the team currently use for CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure management?, What is the process you are following for deploying new features and updates?
what is the package u are using in ur project---------------------->sdk
what are the stages in your piepline--------------------->we have 2 stages one is build and other 1 is deploy.

tell me about yourself
do you support rollback
what will be the good day according to you as a devops engineer
what will be the high level steps if you want to deploy any application
tell me about your ci/cd pipeline
how you monitor the microservices frontend
have you worked on sla's
if the service is down what will be the steps
what is terraform
what is state file in terraform
for what steps you will send an alert according to you
any questions for me

Infosys internal:

what is swap memory------>it is like a virtual memory where the data is store temporaly. like when we want to run a program and at present the ram is full then it will move the least used prgrams to swap so that the new programs will be able to run. when we need the inactive data again them it is swapped from swap memory to ram.
how do we get the active ports in linux----->netstat -tulpn or ss -tulpn
t=tcp ports
u-udp ports
l= all ports
n=ip address
p=proceesid and name of program
UMASK default value for file= 022
how to zip file in linux
master and slave in jenkins
i have a resource in azure portal now i want to manage that in terraform how?----------->terraform import command
terraform import azurerm_virtual_machine.kesh <vmid>.  however this will only update the stat file but not main.tf file. you ahve add the block in main.tf and do terraform apply.
what is load balancer and round robin method
is devops an agile methodolgy--------->agile works on dev side while devops works on dev and it operations side. agile focus on efficiency while devops focus on automation. devops is devoped to for better collaboration betn dev and it operayions team
why use 2 ports in container---------->1 is for host port where we want to run our service and other is container port where our service is listening
write a dockerfile to deploy war file
FROM tomcat:8.5-jre8-openjdk
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/your-application-name
COPY your-application.war .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
how to display particular content of a file in some location in linux---->by using grep, head, tail, sed.  grep "kesh" <path>
what are azure board and why we use that instead of jira--------->this is a visualization tool where we check the workflow.it helps the team to plan, track and dsicuss the work efficiently. we are using this because it has built-in git repositiries eliminating the need for integration with other tools
diff betn classic and yaml pipelines---------->classic is gui based where u drag and drop task and changes are not stored in version control. but in yaml piplines we use yaml file where we define stages, jobs, tasks and others. here changes are stored in git and we can reuse them.
