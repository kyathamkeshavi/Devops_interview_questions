why you used github
how to create dockerfile and components
how to write playbook for loops
what was there before docker
anything you have done on your own
why you have installed tomcat
what are maven dependencies
jenkins architecture
2 types of pipelines
have you done any automation using chef cookbooks
write code for declarative
types of aws ec2-instance
servcie now ticketing tools
daily routine
have you done only support part
automation have you done
jenkins job creation
issues you faced when deploying ci/cd pipeline
--------------------------------------------------------------
what you will do when containers are stopped
what is the storage you used in aws
how to create jenkins job
what is the storage you have worked on in aws
what is the port range you have worked in aws
what is instance have you worked in aws
---------------------------------------------------------------
RELIANCE:
what is issue we faced before ci and we did overcome after ci 
what is cd
for example lets say that 2 dev are writing code and changing same file in 2 diff branches. how will you resolve this issue. ----->git conflict
can we resolve the conflict without taking help of other developer------------->no, we just have to connect with other dev and ask what needs to be changed
git workflow
maven build lifecycle
maven goals
what you meant by human intevention in continous deployment and how does it work
i have one job and have some files in github. in that i dont want 1 file to get executed when my jenkins jobs run. how will you solve this issue
if i want to execute one particular command in dockerfile then how will you do that and build it
how you got into devops role and want is your interest
what does stryker do
how to create a job in jenkins
how to trigger jobs in jenkins
phases in maven
do we need internet to download dependencies in maven
diff between fetch and pull

---------------------------------------------------------------
YESDE:
grep use in linux
can we use grep for finding processes
git squash
how to go inside containers
why we use /bin/bash in containers---------> to run the containers in interactive mode
if my container got crashed then how can we get them back--->volumes
docker networks
why we use security groups---->acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with.
why we use autoscaling---->we use this when you want to increase the vm's when the resource utilizatio exceeds the point 
how to block users in aws
which jobs you have worked on in jenkins
are you using maven as backup only?
what is git rebase
have you worked on disaster recovery modes-->master and slave in jenkins
example i have to create list of users in morning and want to delete them at night. for this what is your approach in ansible
how to install a service in ansible. what are the methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOUDFRONT:
how master and slave nodes are connected? how they communicate? -------------TCP/IP protocol
how to go to new branch
for example i have 1 frd and we want to work on same project using same repo. how to do that
what does pull do in git
what are modules
what module you will use when you want to run the playbook on local machine?-----------script
have you created any ci/cd pipelines
how to delete docker image
how to get into existing container
what is the diff between autoscaling and load balancer and when we use it------>A load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.   
where is inventory path in ansible?-----------/etc/ansible/hosts
i have 5 nodes and want to execute some commands. so do i have to write 5 diff playbooks for that?----------you can create a grp and in playbook write hosts: grpname
have you worked on roles, if yes what are roles and what is the thing you have worked on it
as ansible is agentless tool how it will communicate with nodes?---------by using ssh. we have to establish ss-keygen and ssh-copy-id kesh@ip
how to execute commands in linux?---------by using chmod
what is command for changing owner of file in linux
command to use free space in linux
command to know about cpu usage in linux
what things you take care when launching ec2-instances
can we change ansible.cfg path? -------yes..better to change it in current working directory. if not there it checks in users home dir. 
if not there also it goes to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file
what is vpc?------------virtual private cloud. it enables you to launch aws resources into virtual nkt that you have defined. it allows you to isolate your nkt with other nkts in cloud
difference btwen private and public subnet?---------private means it is not accesible through internet but only through vpc. public means accessible through internet.
what is cloud formation?-----------its an aws service it will let you build entire app from strach
difference between load balancer and auto scaling in aws?----------scaleup and down ec2 instnaces whenevr needed. load balancer distributes incomming data accros multiple ec2 
or containers 
what are elastic ip's?-----------means in normal public ips when ever you start or stop the services public ip gets changed(dynamic). but in elastic ip is fixed(static) and
can be attached to instances.
what is s3 bucket?-------------object simple storage service which stores data as objects in buckets. object contains file and metadata about the files
what is ec2 in aws?-------ec2 is an iaas service. it is a virtual machine which is hosted on cloud.we can run any kind of instances
difference between cloudtrial and cloud watch?---------watch gives you the visibility of performance and healthcheck of resources and applications. 
while trial is an API cal recording and log monitoring web service
