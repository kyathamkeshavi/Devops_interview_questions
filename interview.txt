INFOSYS:

tell me about yourself ----------------->Hello, I’m keshavi, and I am from hyd. I completed my bachelor's degree in 2018 from bvrith. i have 6 years of exp, in intial stages of my career i worked as a sql dba and from past 3 years im working as a devops engineer. my first compnay is tcs and now im working in infosys. With three years of experience as a DevOps engineer, I have developed a strong expertise in various technologies such as Git, GitHub, Azure,jenkins,ansible and Terraform. 
In my role, I drive collaboration between development and operations teams, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in our workflows. I specialize in automating processes, managing infrastructure, and successfully deploying applications. I am committed to delivering high-quality results and enhancing operational performance.
what is docker, why we use them ------------->docker is a open source contanarization tool which creates advanced level of virtualization that is containerization. it is designed to facilitate the application developemt inside software contaniners. we use docker as it is lightweight,less cost,we can resue resources and we can send the images to any other teams so that their application will run efficiently. it has only 1 os which runs contianers, we can easily build and run the containers
why you used github----------------->github is used to store the data where different teams collaborate with each other and developed diifreent versions of code. we used this because various developers can easily identify the changed code and run them in their local machines and test them.
how to create dockerfile and components-------------->dockerfile is a file which contains a set of instructions that are used to create the docker image, there are various components of docker file such as from, cmd, label, run, entrypoint, copy, add etc
how to write playbook for loops-------->playbooks are uually written in yaml file. below is the playbooks for loop 
- hosts: keshavi
  become: yes
  user: kyatham
  connection: ssh
  tasks: 
  - name: "add users"
    user:
      name: {{items.username}}
      state: present
      groups: sudo
      append: yes
      password: "{{items.password}}"
      with_items:
        - { username: 'keshavi', password: 'keshavi' }
        - { username: 'keshavi1', password: 'keshavi1' }
what was there before docker ---------------> we have vmware before docker. its a virtualization technology where many operating systems runs on single physical machine.in vmware every vm has operating system and resources like cpu,ram,rom are not shared. whereas in docker resources are shared and it is more lightweight.
anything you have done on your own
why you have installed tomcat
what are maven dependencies
jenkins architecture ----------> we have 3 components. jenkins master/server, jenkins agent nodes/clouds, jenkins webinterface. on master we have all the configurations such as scheduling job,plugins,users and monitoring etc. on jenkins agent nodes(linux,windows) clouds(docker,k8) this tells us on which the pipeline should run. web intrace gives us the visual representation of pipelines.
2 types of pipelines---------------->declarative & scripted pipeline. declarative stress on what to do rather than how to do. declarative is easy to read.
have you done any automation using chef cookbooks
write code for declarative
types of aws ec2-instance----------->general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, accelerating computing, and high-performance computing (HPC) optimized
servcie now ticketing tools
daily routine
have you done only support part
automation have you done
jenkins job creation
issues you faced when deploying ci/cd pipeline
--------------------------------------------------------------
what you will do when containers are stopped-------->id check the container logs, and then restart the containers using docker start contnername command to start them,check the resource usage on container using docker stats <cont> command, notify the administrators about stopped container. ill check if there is any major impact due to this
what is the storage you used in aws---------->s3(simple storage service)
how to create jenkins job
what is the storage you have worked on in aws
what is the port range you have worked in aws
what is instance have you worked in aws
---------------------------------------------------------------
RELIANCE:
what is issue we faced before ci and we did overcome after ci ---------->Merging code from multiple developers was often complex and time-consuming. This led to integration issues and delays. Manual testing was slow and prone to errors, making it difficult to ensure code quality. Frequent build failures disrupted the development process and delayed releases. Merge conflicts were common when multiple developers worked on the same codebase simultaneously. but after ci, CI encourages small, frequent commits and uses branching strategies to minimize conflicts. CI tools automatically integrate code changes, reducing the complexity and time required for manual merges. Using containerization technologies like Docker, CI ensures consistent across varios environments
what is cd------------>continous deliver or deployment. it means code is deployed on the production environment. 
for example lets say that 2 dev are writing code and changing same file in 2 diff branches. how will you resolve this issue. ----->merge conflict
can we resolve the conflict without taking help of other developer------------->no, we just have to connect with other dev and ask what needs to be changed
git workflow--------->workspace, staging area and local repo
maven build lifecycle
maven goals
what you meant by human intevention in continous deployment and how does it work
i have one job and have some files in github. in that i dont want 1 file to get executed when my jenkins jobs run. how will you solve this issue--------->by using .gitignore or using conditional statemnt in jenkinsfile
if i want to execute one particular command in dockerfile then how will you do that and build it------->RUN command
how you got into devops role and want is your interest
what does stryker do
how to create a job in jenkins
how to trigger jobs in jenkins------->manualy, using grovvy when building pipe, using cron job
phases in maven
do we need internet to download dependencies in maven------->yes, However, there are a few scenarios where you might not need an internet connection:
Local Repository: If you have already downloaded the required dependencies and they are stored in your local Maven repository, you can build your project without an internet connection.
You can manually download dependencies and install them into your local repository.   
Offline Mode: Some Maven tools and plugins allow you to work in offline mode, but this is limited to projects that only rely on dependencies already present in your local repository. This mode is not suitable for most real-world projects, as it restricts access to new dependencies or updates.
diff between fetch and pull---------->in fetch file is not changed in local repo but in pul file is changed in local repo

---------------------------------------------------------------
YESDE:
grep use in linux -----------> The grep command in Linux is a powerful tool used for searching text. grep "search_term" filename. same like filter in windows
can we use grep for finding processes ------> yes, ps -ef | grep <pid>
git squash------>combining multiple commit to single commit. git merge --squash
how to go inside containers-------> docker attach kesh or docker exec -it cont /bin/bash
why we use /bin/bash in containers---------> to run the containers in interactive mode. which is useful for debugging and running commands interactively within the container. This is especially helpful during development and troubleshooting
if my container got crashed then how can we get them back----------->First, check the logs to understand why the container crashed: docker logs <container_id>, Try restarting the container: docker start <container_id>, If your container uses volumes to store data, you can recover the data from these volumes even if the container itself is not running:
docker cp <container_id>:/path/to/data /local/path
docker networks-------->when we want to link multiple contianer we use this. 
why we use security groups---->acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with.
why we use autoscaling---->we use this when you want to increase the vm's when the resource utilizatio exceeds the point 
how to block users in aws

where is inventory path in ansible?-----------/etc/ansible/hosts
i have 5 nodes and want to execute some commands. so do i have to write 5 diff playbooks for that?----------No, you don't need to write five different playbooks to execute commands on five nodes. You can define all your nodes in a single inventory file and use one playbook to target them
have you worked on roles, if yes what are roles and what is the thing you have worked on it
as ansible is agentless tool how it will communicate with nodes?---------by using ssh. we have to establish ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id kesh@ip

can we change ansible.cfg path? -------yes..better to change it in current working directory. if not there it checks in users home dir. 
if not there also it goes to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file
what is vpc?------------virtual private cloud. it enables you to launch aws resources into virtual nkt that you have defined. it allows you to isolate your nkt with other nkts in cloud
difference btwen private and public subnet?---------private means it is not accesible through internet but only through vpc. public means accessible through internet.
what is cloud formation?-----------its an aws service it will let you build entire app from strach. same like terraform and arm template. it acts as an IAC tool
difference between load balancer and auto scaling in aws?----------scaleup and down ec2 instnaces whenevr needed. load balancer distributes incomming data accros multiple ec2 
or containers 
what are elastic ip's?-----------means in normal public ips when ever you start or stop the services public ip gets changed(dynamic). but in elastic ip is fixed(static) and
can be attached to instances.
what is s3 bucket?-------------object simple storage service which stores data as objects in buckets. object contains file and metadata about the files
what is ec2 in aws?-------ec2 is an iaas service. it is a virtual machine which is hosted on cloud.we can run any kind of instances
difference between cloudtrial and cloud watch?---------watch gives you the visibility of performance and healthcheck of resources and applications. 
while trial is an API cal recording and log monitoring web service

SREETECH:
why are you looking for other job, if you already have an offer letter
what playbooks have you written in ansible
why we use handler----------->we use this if to notify other ther services to start
why we use loops in ansible--------------> when we want to execute same thing n number of times then we use loops. for eg if we want to create few users then instead of writing diff playbooks we can mention in 1 playbook about the users and execute it. by this the users will be created

INFOSYS PROJECT INTERVIEWS:

there is a logic app and we are changing them from portal. i need to maintain the versions of changes in azure how?--------------->Open your logic app in the Azure portal.In the left-hand menu, under Development Tools, click Versions.
there is a fucntionapp and azure api. i want to access the fucntionapp using azure api but not from functionapp url how?
what are access policies?----------->where we define the criteria to grant permisssion for various resources. consists of set of rules and configurations
what are the things need to deploy fucntionapp------------->subscription, resource grp, app servive plan, function app name config, storage acnt
do we need storage account to deploy fctn app----->yes
do you have any idea on bicep
how can we make a ctcn between 2 resouces like keyvault and storage account or fucntionapp-------->to securely store and retrieve secrets, such as connection strings, API keys, or certificates. in kv give access to msi that is being refred in storage and function app
if we deploy 5 fcuntionapp do we need 5 keys?-------------------->yes, So, if you deploy 5 Function Apps, each will have its own set of function keys, host keys, and a master key. These keys are unique to each Function App and are not shared between them
things to know about azure api--------------->Azure API Management is a comprehensive service that helps you manage, secure, and monitor APIs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCENTURE:

how to create a build pipeline if you dont have any yaml code and what are the steps included in build pipeline---------------->Creating a build pipeline without using YAML code can be done through the classic editor in Azure DevOps.
can we do testing in build piepline------>yes we can
which is better to deploy web app  is it vm or app service?-------->app service as it is cheap and robust but if you want full control of your application then go for vm
which is better to deploy web app  is it container or app service?---------->If you want more control over the underlying infrastructure, then Azure Container Apps is a better choice. If you want to focus on developing your application and not worry about the underlying infrastructure, then Azure App Service is a better choice.
what is the difference between variable grp and pipleine varble------>piplne vars are used for specific pipleins but variable grp are like centralized which will be used accros the project i.e., diff pipelines
what are the azure policies?----------------> Azure Policy acts like a health inspector during deployment, verifying if the deployed resource meets safety standards (policy rules).
lets say if developers write the code and wants to raise a pr. it should got through reviwers adn merge it. where do we declare the azure policy?------------------>you can do it in branch policy. go to repos-->branches-->branch policy-->slect required revwers, resolution for comment,status check, link work item whatever that is needed and save the changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZENSAR:

tell me about yourslef
tell me end to end implementation in your project and what are the complex things you faced
how you used to deploy the resources. is it directly on prod or non prod?---------->dev, qa and production
what are testing you used to do before deploying the services.-------------------->Ensures that the entire application flow works as expected from start to finish, Validates that the software functions according to the specified requirements, security code reviews, Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures that the application is secure from threats,  ensure the software is stable, secure, and performs as expected.
what are the branching startegies you used in your project?------------>we have main and feature branches. we take the code from main barnch and create anew branch. once the testing and everything is done we will merge it to main branch
how do you integrate git with azure repos ----------------------->install git in local, go to ado and create a new repo and clone the repo in your local. make the changes in your system and add commit and push them to azure repo.
what do you mean by system integration-------------->System integration is the process of combining different subsystems or components into a single, cohesive system that functions as a unified whole. This involves ensuring that the various components work together seamlessly to achieve the desired functionality and performance.
have you worked on terraform if yes how did you implement it
what kind of work have you done in terraform
what are terraform provisoners------------>Terraform provisioners are components that allow you to execute scripts or commands on local or remote machines as part of the resource creation or destruction process. They enable additional configuration and setup tasks that can't be accomplished with Terraform's declarative syntax alone. Here’s a detailed look at provisioners: Local-Exec Provisioner, remote-exec, File Provisioner
on which environment did you tested the terraform
what do you mean by remote state in terraform--------------->In Terraform, remote state refers to storing the state file in a remote location instead of locally on your machine. The state file is a critical component that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure, allowing Terraform to manage and apply changes accurately
what are the security implementation you have done in your projects---------------->Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have the minimum necessary permissions, Managed encryption keys securely using services like Azure Key Vault, Configured virtual private networks (VPNs) and network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
you have mentioned the efficiency is increased by 30% in your resume. can you describe about it--------------------->Implemented automated unit and integration tests using a CI/CD pipeline, Reduced configuration errors and deployment time by automating infrastructure provisioning. wrote the arm template for creating restricting the user by creating the rbac role. previosuly we used to have classic pipeline for release, we created yaml pipeline so that both build and release pipelines can be done at once.
have you worked on azure monitoring tools?
how do you recommend the service for the client--------------------> Understand the Client's Needs, Research and evaluate different services that could meet the client's needs.
Consider factors such as cost, features, scalability, and support, Customize your recommendation to align with the client's specific needs and preferences.
are you able to work in night shift
did you do any certifications
why you are looking for job change?---------------------->I'm always eager to learn and take on new opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in different ways and contribute to exciting projects.

how does devops helps in the industry
core prospects or fucntionalities in devops----------->plan,code,build,test.ci,cd,monitoring
what is the pull request------------>pull request is nothing but combining the code that is there in our branch with the other branch. usualy we create pr when we want to merge our code to main/master in the remote barnch.
what is service connection--------------->it is used to make a connection between azure services, or external services like docker, github etc with azure pipelines.
what are the tyoes of pipelines in azure devops and explain them------------>classic and yaml pipeline
in your projects which pipeline you used--------> we used yaml for build pipeline and classic for release
if you are using the yaml pipeline then what will be the task type for dot net application----------->UseDotNet@2
how do you test and deploy the services------------->first of all we will write the code and then push it to remote repository. once our code is there in remote repo we will trigger the pipelines and check if everything is successful or not in the logs
when you want to add new service in the existing pipeline how do you do it------------>in classic pipeline we can add a new stage or create a new task in the existing stage
what is the difference between complte mode and incremental mode in arm template----------->complete mode: If your resource group initially contains Resource A, Resource B, and Resource C, and your template specifies only Resource A and Resource B, then Resource C will be deleted after deployment. incremental mode: If your resource group initially contains Resource A, Resource B, and Resource C, and your template specifies Resource A, Resource B, and Resource D, after deployment, the resource group will contain Resource A, Resource B, Resource C, and Resource D
what are build and release task you are using. give me the task names in yaml file
which powershell command do you use for deploying arm template---------------->New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "ExampleResourceGroup" -TemplateFile "C:\MyTemplates\azuredeploy.json" -TemplateParameterFile "C:\MyTemplates\azuredeploy.parameters.json"
using terraform how to deploy the infrastructure
what is the state file------------------->A state file is a JSON file that stores metadata about the resources managed by your IaC tool. It includes details such as resource IDs, configurations, and dependencies1. It helps the IaC tool understand the current state of your infrastructure, enabling it to determine what changes need to be applied during subsequent deployments

how do you store secrets and certs in keyvault------------------>we already have a service connection where it was created using msi. and this msi we are using in keyvault and add it in accesspolicies and give whatever the permissions that are needed to fetch the secrets&certs. and we use a task(UseAzureKeyVault@1) in pipeline to fetch the secrets using service connection
where are your artifacts stored----------------->y default, pipeline artifacts are stored in the $(Pipeline.Workspace) directory. Artifacts are stored in Azure Artifacts feeds, which are repositories for your packages
can we change the storage path when we are generating the artifact. means i want to store my artifact in custom path how to do it---------->You can specify the custom path in your pipeline YAML file using the publish keyword or the PublishPipelineArtifact task.
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/custom/path'
    artifact: 'my-artifact'
how you will approve the task in azure devops and what are the steps

What is Docker file and how you create it--------------------->dockerfile is a file which contains a set of instructions that are used to create the docker image, there are various components of docker file such as from, cmd, label, run, entrypoint, copy, add etc
Why we are starting with from in Docker file. Why we are using it------------>The FROM command initializes a new build stage and sets the base image for subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile. It essentially tells Docker which existing image to use as a starting point, which can be any valid image from Docker Hub or a custom image from a local repository
What are the resources you worked on till now--------------------->kv, storage acount, msi, app service, traffic manager
Why we are using traffic manager--------------->we use traffic manager to distribute the tarffic accross global regions
How many types of load balanacers in azure-------------------->4. 
Different layers in traffic manager In aure--------------->it operats at dns level. dns resolution: it responds to dns query by using ip adress. traffic routing methods:

canada life:

tell us what u know abt canada life
do you have any idea on github actions---------------------->GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate your software development workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying code.
why we need ci and its usage------------------->Early Detection of Issues. as the code is integrated multiple times we can easily detect and resolve issues. it improves code quality as the new code doesnot break the existing functinality. we will also get fatser feedback for the devlopers. it also increase the collaboration between dif teams and reducing the merge conflicts
compliance you have done on your project---------------------->Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign permissions based on user roles to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data.Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) solutions like Azure AD to manage access controls. Code Reviews: Regular code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
you mentioned u increased efficiency in resume explain about it---------------->previously in the project we used to have yml pipeline only for build and for release we used to have classic pipeline. but now we are using yml file which contains both build n deploy stages. and also previously we used to have different files for prod int dev. but now we segregated all the files in a single file and given condition that if the previous env is succesful then it should start the next env. apart from this we are now using terraform for creatign infra and ansible to configure the infra in one go
tell us the overview of your project--------------->tell them about ci/cd pipleine 
what have u done in your project and your experince------------->tell the about your daily activities
any qstns u have for us-------------------->What tools and technologies does the team currently use for CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure management?, What is the process you are following for deploying new features and updates?
what is the package u are using in ur project---------------------->sdk
what are the stages in your piepline--------------------->we have 2 stages one is build and other 1 is deploy.

tell me about your ci/cd pipeline
how you monitor the microservices frontend
have you worked on sla's
if the service is down what will be the steps
what is terraform
what is state file in terraform
for what steps you will send an alert according to you
any questions for me

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infosys internal:

what is swap memory------>it is like a virtual memory where the data is store temporaly. like when we want to run a program and at present the ram is full then it will move the least used prgrams to swap so that the new programs will be able to run. when we need the inactive data again them it is swapped from swap memory to ram.
how do we get the active ports in linux----->netstat -tulpn or ss -tulpn
t=tcp ports
u-udp ports
l= all ports
n=ip address
p=proceesid and name of program
UMASK default value for file= 022
how to zip file in linux------->tar -cvf <dir>.tar <dir>, gzip <dir>.tar
master and slave in jenkins
i have a resource in azure portal now i want to manage that in terraform how?----------->terraform import command
terraform import <azurerm_virtual_machine>.<kesh> <vmid>.  however this will only update the stat file but not main.tf file. you ahve add the block in main.tf and do terraform apply.
what is load balancer and round robin method
is devops an agile methodolgy--------->agile works on dev side while devops works on dev and it operations side. agile focus on efficiency while devops focus on automation. devops is devoped to for better collaboration betn dev and it operations team
why use 2 ports in container---------->1 is for host port where we want to run our service and other is container port where our service is listening
write a dockerfile to deploy war file
FROM tomcat:8.5-jre8-openjdk
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/your-application-name
COPY your-application.war .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
how to display particular content of a file in some location in linux---->by using grep, head, tail, sed.  grep "kesh" <path>
what are azure board and why we use that instead of jira--------->this is a visualization tool where we check the workflow.it helps the team to plan, track and dsicuss the work efficiently. we are using this because it has built-in git repositiries eliminating the need for integration with other tools
diff betn classic and yaml pipelines---------->classic is gui based where u drag and drop task and changes are not stored in version control. but in yaml piplines we use yaml file where we define stages, jobs, tasks and others. here changes are stored in git and we can reuse them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAPGEIMI: L1 interview(2025)

tell me about yourself
i have 40 commits but i want only 3 specific commits and merge them into master. how to do it?--------> git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>
i have 40 commits but now i want to merge them into 3. how can we do it?------------->You can squash your 40 commits into 3 using interactive rebase.  git rebase -i HEAD~3. once we get the window modify the pick to sqaush and then commit it. by this we can do 40 comits to 3
i have some code but it is not there in the stage to commit. i want to save in working directory so that i can use it later. how to do it?--------->You can use git stash to save your uncommitted changes in the working directory and apply them later when needed. <git stash apply>
i have some work and added using git add. but now i want to revert this change how can we achieve it?---------->git reset HEAD <file> or git reset .
what is service connection and how we will configure?---------------> we use this when we want to connect azure resources or external resources with azure pipelines. to create SC we first have to go to project settings in ADO and look for service connection. create new SC and select the arm and after that choose the service principal or MSI and give neccesary tenant id, sub id, service key, name and click on create
what is approvals and gates in ado?------------>Approvals are manual interventions that require someone (like a manager or developer) to approve or reject a deployment before proceeding. Gates are automated checks that ensure certain conditions are met before moving forward.
i have a pipeline for image build and push. now i want to trigger the pipeline where if i make any changes in some particular folder then only the pipeline is triggered. give me the codition for this
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main  # Adjust the branch as needed
  paths:
    include:
      - path/to/your/folder/  # Only trigger when files in this folder change
i have 3 stages dev, test, prod. but i want to skip the test stage. how to do it-----------> we can use depends on section in prod. so that test will skip and after dev it will directly go to prod
how to configure self hosted agent in ado----->Go to Azure DevOps → Organization Settings → Agent Pools->add pool. Navigate to Project Settings → Agent Pools → Select your pool (SelfHostedPool).-->new agent(select linunx/win). run commands on system. check if the agent is online or not. we need personal access token
i have main.tf, and if i do terraform apply, how it will interact with ado and azure----------->Authenticate with Azure (via az login or service principal).
Read main.tf and apply changes.Store Updated State file in storage account(to keep track of managed resources).
i want to use 1 rg for multiple subscription. how to give this in main.tf in terraform----------> give diff sub in diff providers section. we cannot use 1 rg for diff sub
provider "azurerm" {
  alias           = "sub1"
  subscription_id = "SUBSCRIPTION_ID_1"
  features {}
}
provider "azurerm" {
  alias           = "sub2"
  subscription_id = "SUBSCRIPTION_ID_2"
  features {}
}
someone has manualy updated the vm. but now when i use terraform what will happen-------->use terraform refresh command
what is terraform refresh command---------->Syncs Terraform state with real infrastructure from portal
i want to create vm. but vnet and subnet are already present. now i want to use them and create vm using terraform. how to do it---------->Since your VNet and Subnet already exist, you don't need to create them in Terraform. Instead, you can fetch their details using data command data.azurerm_virtual_network and data.azurerm_subnet
To create a VM in Azure using Terraform, you need the following:
✅ Resource Group – The container for all resources.
✅ Virtual Network & Subnet – To enable network communication.
✅ Public IP (Optional) – To access the VM externally.
✅ Network Security Group (NSG) – To control traffic.
✅ Network Interface Card (NIC) – Connects the VM to the network.
✅ VM Configuration – OS type, size, admin credentials, storage account
what is datablocks in terraform------------>we use this when we want to know the details of existing resources. we use resource blk to create a new resource
what is tfstate file and how u are storing in your current project. is it locally or remote------------>In Azure DevOps, Terraform state is typically stored remotely using Azure Storage. tf state consists of metadata. it tells us what are the resources are desired and actual resources
what is docker volume-------->used for storing databases, logs, or application data. we use it as a backup. when we make any changes in 1 volume it will reflect in other volumes as well if we share it
what is the difference between cmd and run in docker and in which stages these command will execute------->run is used in build time, cmd is used at container run time. cmd can be overwritten, run canot be overwrite
suppose we have cmd arguement and entrypoint argument. which will execut first in docker----------->ENTRYPOINT executes first, and CMD acts as arguments to ENTRYPOINT
can we override entrypoint or not------------>Yes, you can override ENTRYPOINT in Docker, but it requires the --entrypoint flag when running the container. docker run --entrypoint cat myimage /etc/os-release
i have vm in prod. now i want to increase size without downtime. is this posssible---------->Yes, increasing the size of a virtual machine (VM) in Azure can be done without downtime, but there are some important steps and considerations to keep in mind. one of the process is below:
If you use a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS):
Add new VMs with the desired size.
Gradually switch traffic to the new VMs.
Remove old VMs after migration.
can we trigger another pipeline from 1 pipeline---------------> yes, we can do that Using pipeline Task.
jobs:
- job: Trigger_Pipeline_B
  steps:
  - task: AzurePipelines@1
    inputs:
      definition: 'Pipeline_B_Name'
      project: 'YourProject'
      waitForCompletion: true 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KANERIKA:

tell me about yourself
can you tell me the pipeline you have configured
brief me about the steps in ci/cd pipeline in your project
tell me how will you integrate git with azure. how the pipeline os triggered
do you have any experience in ansible
how will you store the secrets in ansible------------->Ansible Vault is a tool built into Ansible for encrypting sensitive data such as passwords or keys.ansible-vault create secrets.yml
what is dynamic inventory in ansible--------->A Dynamic Inventory in Ansible allows you to automatically pull information about the hosts from external sources, such as cloud providers, databases, or APIs, rather than manually defining all the hosts in an inventory.ini file. This is particularly useful in environments where hosts change frequently, such as cloud-based infrastructures (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), where new instances may be created or terminated on-demand.
do you have exp in k8
can you tell me in docker commands. cmd and entrypoint which is overwritten------------>both can be overwrtitten. ENTRYPOINT is not overwritten unless explicitly replaced by using the --entrypoint flag when running the container. CMD can be overwritten when you pass new arguments at runtime.
give the docker command to overwrite the entrypoint----------------->docker run --entrypoint cat myimage /etc/os-release
can you tell me how you interact with the container. tell me the command to go inside the container----------------->docker exec -it is generally the preferred method to enter a container because it opens an interactive shell session without affecting the main process.
docker attach is useful if you need to see output from the container’s primary process or interact with it directly (but not for opening a shell).
where .tf state file is stored in azure? which module we can say it is stored----------->The Terraform state file is stored in Azure Storage using the azurerm backend.
did you write the terraform code from strach 
do you have any questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROARCH:

tell me about yourslef
which ci/cd tool you have worked on-------->azure devops
did u get any chance to work on github actions
where are you storing your code in your project--------->azure repos. they are asking about version control code 
how do u establish a connection between git and azure devops----------->tell them how u integrate git with ado
branching strategies u are following in your project--------->main,feature,develop. we develop code in develop and do test there. once it is succesful raise pr to feature and do testing in qa and once done then raise pr to main
how you are merging feature to develop
were there any checks during the pr merge----------->tell them about branching policy(need aprovers, work items, resolving the comments) REPO-->branches-->...-->branch policy.
services you worked on azure------------>kv, msi, storage, vm, 
apart from azure have you worked on any other cloud
i want to fetch the secrets in ado. how do you fetch the secrets from kv to ado---------->give kv secret user or officer permission on user and the use azurekeyvault@2 task in yaml pipeline.
is it possible to restrict other users using storage account. i want only 1 person to access the storage account how to do it----------->go to access policy(IAM) in storage and remove all the access other than the person who need it. check the role assignment
is it possible to whitelist the ip and give access to that ip--------->if you want to restrict access based on IP, go to:
Storage Account → Networking → Firewalls and Virtual Networks
Whitelist only the allowed IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10)
Block all other traffic
please tell me the difference between arm template and terraform---------->terraform multi cloud. arm, only on azure
tell me one main diff between arm and terraform------------>arm doesnt contain state file while terraform does
does arm template maintain statefile?--------->No, ARM templates do not maintain a state file. 
if arm template doesnt maintain any statefile then how does it know whether it has created the resources or not------------->Azure Resource Manager (ARM) directly interacts with the Azure platform to determine the current state of resources at the time of deployment. There's no concept of a state file like in Terraform because Azure already knows the current state of resources through its internal systems.
what is the least privilage we can give to someone to read the secrets-------->Key Vault Secrets User
if i give u contributor access on sub. will you be able to assign role permission?-------->no. they can only manage resources
can we create a role with contributor access--------->❌ Default Contributor Role → CANNOT assign roles  ✅ Custom Contributor Role (With Extra Permissions i.e., role assignement permission) → CAN assign roles
3 major things when we create or assign a role. tell me about them---------->resource name, type of access, user id
in ado can we store artifacts. can we see the artifact in ado--------->steps:
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
    artifactName: "my-artifact"
in ado do u see any environments. if yes did u come accros any situation in your project------------>Environments in ADO are used for:
Managing deployments across different stages (e.g., Dev, QA, Staging, Production).
Applying approvals and security checks before moving to production.
Tracking deployments and logs for auditing purposes.
Go to Azure DevOps Portal-->Navigate to Pipelines → Environments.
Configured approval gates in ADO Environments.
Dev → Auto Deploy
QA → Requires Approval
Prod → Requires Manual Approval + Security Check
you are creating resources through arm template. is it directly performing or through ci/cd pipeline
is there any condition you are using in ci/cd pipeline--------->condition: succeeded(), depends on, condition: or(failed(), canceled())
imagine a situation where we created storage account in portal. now i want to get that in terraform is that possible?----------->terraform import <resourcetype>.<name>
have you used workspace in terraform------------>Yes! I have worked with workspaces in Terraform, and they are quite useful for managing multiple environments like dev, staging, and prod with the same Terraform configuration but with diff state file.
what commands you have worked on terraform
why did you use both terraform and arm template
there is an extension in arm template in azure---------->bicep
did u ever get the chance to work on bicep. why did microsft develop bicep even though they have arm template----------->Microsoft developed Bicep as a simplified syntax for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. ARM templates have been the primary way to deploy resources in Azure, but they can be verbose and difficult to manage, especially for complex deployments. Bicep addresses these challenges while still being fully compatible with ARM. it is easy to read the syntax.

how many stages are there in yaml pipeline which u have written for webapp
i want to deploy the webapp in diff env. how to do it--------->create diff stages for diff env after build stage
dotnet restore or dontnet test is there in your yaml. are u not using it
without dotnetrestore is it going to work. is it going to deploy webapp------>Yes, the pipeline will still deploy the web app even without dotnet restore and dotnet test, but it is not recommended for production. if we dont use test then bugs and code validation is not done.
what are doing with you arm template. how you are deploying it
i have webapp and storage blob storage. now i want to access the webapp using blob. how to do it--------->give storage blob contributor in storage account using msi. add msi in webapp.
what are event driven things in functional app. how u used to trigger

types of event driven triggers in functional app
do u have any questions for me

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAGARRO:
i have a terraform file and im commiting my changes. if other developer also want to deploy the same how can this be possible------->Terraform stores its state in a file (terraform.tfstate). To ensure multiple developers can safely deploy, use a remote backend like, Azure Blob Storage, or Terraform Cloud. This prevents state conflicts and allows for collaboration. 
i dont want other developers to deploy when im deploying in terraform. how to do it----------->the most common and recommended approach is using Azure Storage Account with Blob Lease Locks. by this if one person is deploying then other person will get lock mechanism error
how to use older version code in the pipeline from the github. like there are 5 commit histories, but i want to use 3rd committed code.--------->The git step clones the repository. The git checkout <commitid> command checks out the 3rd commit.
what is multi staging in docker---------->Multi-stage builds in Docker are a way to optimize your Dockerfile by using multiple FROM statements to create temporary intermediate images. This approach helps reduce the final image size by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.
do u have exp in hasicorp vault?--------->HashiCorp Vault is a tool designed for securely accessing secrets, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more
tell me about yourself
in kubernetes which tools have u used?
what do u know about k8?-------->master, pods, clusters, nodes. used for microservices management., helm chat for app deployment in k8 clusters
diff between entrypoint nd cmd in docker
what are vulneribilities scanning in ur pipeline------->we use microsoft defender for cloud to do all the security checks. iac scanning for validating iac against security policy. secret scanning to check the secrets are being exposed. dependency scanning i.e., synk. Identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and suggests fixes
have you done monitoring---------->Azure Monitor. Centralized monitoring solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-prem environments.used for Monitoring resource performance (CPU, memory, etc.)
Azure Application Insights: A feature of Azure Monitor designed specifically for monitoring live applications, especially useful for developers. used for Monitoring the health and performance of web apps and API
Azure Log Analytics: Collects and queries logs from various sources (Azure resources, VMs, on-prem servers) for deep diagnostics. used for Centralized log management and querying.
explain about your pipeline
do u use .dotnet package---->yes
any scanning in middle of your pipeline if yes then how?----------->iac scanning for validating iac against security policy. secret scanning to check the secrets are being exposed. dependency scanning i.e., synk. Identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and suggests fixes
code quality checks in pipeline---------->iac scanning for validating iac against security policy. secret scanning to check the secrets are being exposed. dependency scanning i.e., synk. Identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and suggests fixes
how u handle secrets
where do u store state file and why?--------->azure storage account
i created manualy resource. can i again do it in terraform?----------->terraform import
i want 3vms at a time. how can we do that in terraform--------->count
how to do code reusability-------------->modules
you have an app which is in vm. what steps are there to expose it on abc.com. what type of config you do
what is load balancer--------->
Load Balancer type				    Layer		Use Case
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Load Balancer				    L4			Distributing traffic to VMs (public/private)
Azure Application Gateway		  L7			Web applications with advanced routing
Azure Front Door				      L7			Global load balancing and site acceleration
Azure Traffic Manager			    DNS			Traffic distribution across global regions

you worked on free or enterprise of terraform----->yes worked on enterprise edition which provides remote state file
where did u store state file-------->azure storage account
have you worked on modules---------->modules are smallest part of code which provides reusability of code
if i want to execute terraform script, it should first do these steps. how to do it. any way to tell them to execute first----------->use depends_on 
have experience in security group-------------->A Security Group in Azure is a virtual firewall used to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources within a Virtual Network (VNet). It allows or denies traffic based on rules you define. Security groups are commonly used to control access to virtual machines (VMs), network interfaces, and other resources that are part of a VNet.

where we get service principal(app id)-------------->In the Azure Portal, navigate to Azure Active Directory or microsoft entra id--->On the left-hand menu, click App registrations and app id.
how log insights work---------->Log Insights in Azure is powered by Azure Monitor Logs and Log Analytics. It collects, stores, and analyzes logs from different Azure resources, applications, and on-premises environments. Logs are stored in an Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
The logs can be categorized into:
Activity Logs (Azure resource actions)
Diagnostic Logs (VM performance, database errors, etc.)
Custom Logs (from apps & scripts)
diff between log analytics and application insights------------->
✔ Use Log Analytics if you want to monitor infrastructure, security logs, VM performance, network activity.
✔ Use Application Insights if you need deep application monitoring, request tracing, and user behavior insights.

MOTIVITYLABS:

tell me about yourself
how good are you with linux operating systems
my app is not working and got an alert at 5 am how you will troubleshoot this issue---------->What was the alert message? (e.g., high latency, service unavailable, memory leak), Is this a recurring issue or the first time?ook at logs in Application Insights, Azure Monitor, or directly on the server/container.
Search for errors, exceptions, or unusual activity around 5 AM. Check if any deployments or updates happened before the issue. Is the app reachable?High CPU, Memory, or Disk usage at 5 AM?Check for network issues affecting outbound or inbound traffic.any storage, db or pipeline issue. Try running a test request to simulate the error. If deployment caused it, roll back to a previous stable version.
my new version code is not there in webapp. how do you troubleshoot it---------------->check if the pipeline deployment is succesful or not. check if the github is using the latest version or not. clear and restart the webapp. verify build and runtime error. check the logs
why git is known as distributed version control system-------->because it has both local and remote repo. even if 1 repo doesnt work we can take the code from other repo
what is staging area in git------------>where we add the code before comit. its like saving the code in local repo
how do you identify the folder is there under version control system---------->check the .git folder or do git status. if we doesnt get any error then it is under version control
why we use git rebase command---------->when we want to rewrite the commit history we use rebase. by this 1 branch is completely changed to other branch along with commit history
when we use git pull, merge and fetch----------->pull to get the changed code. fetch to check the changed code. merge to merge our code to other code
which is best among all three -----------> depends upon the task
diff between availablity set and Zones
Feature	                Availability Set	                                                                  Availability Zone
Definition	            Logical grouping of VMs across fault & update domains within a single data center.	Physically separate data centers within the same Azure region.                 Scope	Works within a single data center (same region).	                           Spans multiple data centers within a region.
Update Domain (UD)	    Ensures VMs don’t get updated simultaneously.	                                      Updates are done per zone, reducing downtime.
VM Placement	          VMs are placed across multiple racks in one data center.	                          VMs are placed in different physical locations (zones).
Example Services	      VMs, SQL databases with availability groups.	                                      VM Scale Sets, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
components in availability set and zone
pre requisite to host webapp----------->host service(vm/app service), subscription, rg, storage, code, vnet,nsg, application gateway or front door, pipeline, monitoring and security
why we use RBAC---------->used in Azure to manage user permissions securely and efficiently. It ensures that users have only the permissions they need—nothing more.
in vm if we want to use kv then what permissions we have to give---------->use msi in vm, and go to kv and use this msi and give permission
why we use service principal-------------->A Service Principal (SP) is used in Azure to allow applications, scripts, or automation tools to authenticate and access Azure resources securely without using user credentials
have you setup any point to point VPNs
why we use NSG------------>An Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is used to control inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources (like Virtual Machines, Subnets, or Load Balancers). It acts as a firewall that allows or denies traffic based on rules.
i want to use 1vnet to communicate with other vnet. how to do it----------->1️⃣ VNet Peering (Best for low latency, high-speed communication)
2️⃣ VNet-to-VNet VPN (IPsec Tunnel) (Best for cross-region or different subscriptions)

what are the components in arm template
i kept username and password in kv. now i want to use that to connect to db------------>assign kv permission to resources and retrieve credentials
things should be there in terraform file
diff between import and data---------->1️⃣ import — Bringing External Resources into State 2️⃣ data — Fetching Information About Existing Resources
diff between Version and Version control---------->vesrion refers to what version you are using in terraform. version control referes to where you are storing the terraform code(git,butbucket)
where you are storing state file
how can we delete resources from state file---------->f you want to remove a resource from Terraform state (without deleting the actual resource in the cloud), you can use terraform state rm
have you setup any ci/cd pipeline. what is build n release pipeline------------->🔹 Build Pipeline → Compiles code, runs tests, and packages artifacts.
🔹 Release Pipeline → Deploys built artifacts to environments (Dev, QA, Prod).
by default ansible has log file-------->no
in order to create log file in ansible what things you will do------->Modify your ansible.cfg file to enable logging permanently.
[defaults]
log_path = /var/log/ansible.log
how to setup own config file in ansible----------->Create a file named ansible.cfg in your working directory and give inventory, log path, hsot evrything there
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/path/to/custom/ansible.cfg----------->run this command to force use custom config File

Governance	              Use Azure Policy/AWS SCP to restrict expensive resources
Quota Management	        Enforce limits on CPU, memory, and VM counts
security things for iac configuration. do you have any idea within terraform for security thing------------->✔ Use Azure Key Vault / AWS Secrets Manager instead of hardcoding secrets.
✔ Use Terraform’s sensitive = true attribute to mask sensitive outputs.
✔ Restrict Terraform user permissions (avoid exposing credentials).
challenged faced with terraform and resolved it------------>mismatch of infra with respect to cloud and terraform, secret storing, missing values of variables, resource already Exists
how to restore the deleted state file-------------->if storing remotely take the state file from deleted blobs or previos version in storage account. or check if it manualy taken backup then restore it from there. if we dont have any of these then do terraform import <resourcetype>.<name>.<resourceid>. after this do plan and apply.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SONATA:

for eg when there is a resource in terraform but i dont want to use this as it is damaged when i do apply. how to do it----------->we can use terraform taint for the resources. terraform taint type.name. when we use this and terraform apply the tainted resource is deleted and a new one is created.
tell me about the ci/cd pipelines which you have deployed
what are the build tools which you are currently using------->dotnet CLI
how do you take care of parallel build in pipeline--------------------->give multiple jobs in yaml file. they will run paralelly
for an automatic trigger what u will do for pipeline------------------->cron, branches, manual trigger, changes in folder
Continuous Integration (CI) Trigger: Runs the pipeline whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.
Pull Request (PR) Trigger: Runs the pipeline when a pull request is created or updated.
Scheduled Trigger: Runs the pipeline at a specific time or interval.
Resource Trigger: Starts the pipeline based on changes in specified resources (e.g., builds, repositories).
Webhook Trigger: Executes the pipeline in response to external events, such as updates in a GitHub repository
hows your current branching strategy-------------->master: for production-ready code
develop: where features are merged and tested before release
feature/*: for individual development tasks
what is local and global variable in pipeline------------->Local variables are defined within a specific scope, such as a job or a step.Global variables are defined at the pipeline level and can be accessed by any job or step within the pipeline.
i have 2 diff branches and 1 has to trigger to dev env and 1 has to trigger qa env--------------->give branch details in trigger scope and give different jobs for dev and qa. use condition statement so it will trigger for specific branch: condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'dev-branch')
what is diff between rebase and merge------------>Rebase moves or re-applies commits from one branch onto another base commit. This process rewrites the commit history, creating new commits with new SHA-1 hashes. while merge creates a commit which has code of 2 developers
do we have history id in rebase------------->In Git, when you perform a rebase, the commit history is rewritten. This means that the original commit IDs (SHA-1 hashes) are changed because the commits are applied on top of a new base commit. However, Git does not maintain a history ID specifically for rebases.
diff between continous delivery and deployment. how you are using in your project give me an example----------->if we use manual approver stage in yaml then it is delivery. but if we dont use that then it is deploymment
how do you connect to ado using login
how do you debud any pipeline---------->go to pipeline and check logs. check the resources utilization. if we have minitoring tools check them for logs
how to create a image out of container--------------->docker commit container_id new_image_name
diff between docker add and copy
how do you redeploy the docker image if it is corrupted
Stop Running Containers:  docker ps -q --filter "ancestor=my_app:latest" | xargs docker stop
Remove the Corrupted Image:  docker rmi my_app:latest
Pull the Image Again:  docker pull my_app:latest
Recreate and Start Containers:  docker-compose up -d
services you worked on azure and where we use nsg---------------->Virtual Machines (VMs):
Inbound Traffic: Control access to VMs by allowing or denying traffic from specific IP addresses or ranges.
Outbound Traffic: Restrict VMs from accessing certain external resources.
what is state file and lifecycle of it------------>Initialization:
When you first run terraform init, Terraform initializes the working directory and sets up the backend configuration for the state file.
Creation: During the first terraform apply, Terraform creates the state file and records the initial state of the resources.
Updates: Every time you run terraform apply after making changes to your configuration, Terraform updates the state file to reflect the new state of the resources.
Storage: The state file is stored either locally or remotely, depending on your backend configuration.
Locking: To prevent concurrent modifications, Terraform can lock the state file during operations. This is especially important in collaborative environments.
Backup: Terraform often creates backup copies of the state file before making changes. This helps in recovering the state in case of errors.
Migration: You can migrate the state file from one backend to another using terraform state commands. This is useful when changing storage solutions or moving to a more secure backend.
write a terraform file for auto scaling instance and vpn
powershell script to upload file that has .csv extension------------># Create the context for the storage account
$context = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $storageAccountKey
# Upload the file to the blob container
Set-AzStorageBlobContent -File $filePath -Container $containerName -Blob $blobName -Context $context
how to check cpu usage for linux----------->top,htop,vmstat
list all vms in stopped state in 1 rg-------------->az vm list --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --query "[?powerState=='VM stopped'].{Name:name}" --output table

diff access control mechanisms in azure----------->msi,aad,rbac,iam
if i want to add new environment to a varibale how to do it using powershell for app service--------------------->Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $appName -AppSettings $appSettings.Properties
give me the example how you solved performance issue using azure monitor--------->for a webapp there is high traffic during peak hr. so we adapted autoscaling of vm so when the cpu >80 then it should increase the vm
how terraform is integrated with ado

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HEXAWARE:

tell me about your self
things that are there in terraform file
i want to deploy 10 reosurces at a time. how to do it in terraform----------->use count fucntion
i want to deploy 10 resources with diff configuration at diff locations, how to do it in terraform----------->use foreach()
why we use output file in terraform-------->we use output files (or just outputs) to expose useful information about the infrastructure we've provisioned.
what is diff between variable and tfvar file--------->variable define the inputs, their types, defaults, and descriptions while tfvar file actually give values to the variables you declared earlier
how do you secure state file--------->store it in remote account. give limited acces to remote state file using rbac and iam control
when there is a conflict in terraform how do you handle it---------->use blob lease lock
there is a manual edition in cloud. how do you handle it------->use terraform refresh 
when we do terraform refresh where the file will be chnaged is it state file? if it is state file then how the main.tf is changed------->Check the updated values in terraform show or the terraform.tfstate file. Manually copy important values into your main.tf
give me the structure of ci/cd pipeline
what jobs are executed in build
what are agent pools-------------->An agent pool is a collection of agents used in Azure DevOps and Azure Container Registry to run tasks and pipelines.
where you will deploy your code------------>webapp
how you provision vms. how do you deploy your code in webapp--------------->we can deploy your application as a ZIP package to Azure App Service. This method involves creating a ZIP file of your project and uploading it to the service.
what are all the things that are required for docker
architecture of k8
how you store secrets
diff between service principal and msi------------->service principal is mainly used to authentaticate the appplications and it works accross multiple tenants, mainly used in ci/cd pipelines. msi is used to access resources from other resource. doesnot create secrets and can only be used in same tenants
do you have experience in building db pipeline
any certifcations in azure
what are the applications you have build and deploy'----------->web applications
issues faced with pipeline--------------->Build Failures:
Code Errors: Syntax errors, missing dependencies, or failed tests can cause builds to fail.
Slow Pipelines:
Resource Bottlenecks: Limited CPU, memory, or I/O resources can slow down the pipeline.
Deployment Failures:
Configuration Issues: Incorrect configuration settings or missing environment variables can cause deployments to fail.
Security Vulnerabilities:
Exposed Secrets: Hardcoded credentials or improperly managed secrets can lead to security breaches.
Integration Issues:
Service Dependencies: Changes in one service affecting the functionality of another.
default directories in azure devops----------->System.DefaultWorkingDirectory: This is the local path on the agent where your source code files are downloaded. It's essentially the root of your repository.
Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory: This directory is used to store build artifacts before they are published. It's a temporary location for files that will be shared between build and release stages.
Build.SourcesDirectory: This directory contains the source code that is checked out by the pipeline. It's typically a subdirectory within the System.DefaultWorkingDirectory2.
Build.BinariesDirectory: This directory is used to store compiled binaries and other intermediate files generated during the build process2.
Agent.TempDirectory: A temporary directory used by the agent for various tasks during the pipeline execution2.
what is git cherrypick
diff between merge and rebase
how to create new branch
deployemnt startegies you follow in your project ----------->blue-green, others are canary and rollback
if you deployed wrong version. how do you go back to previous version-------------->use git revert and push the chnages again
how do you do code analysis in your project--------->microsoft defender

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FNF:

tell me about yourself
have you ever created infra part completely using terraform---------> 
how do you use terraform in azure pipeline------------>we give working directory path in yaml. thats how it will get to know the tf files and execute them. we neeed rg, storage,container,key, service connection, working directory in task
where does statefile reside in azure------------->storage account in blob
how do you lock the terraform state file-------> if we use terraform backend in files then it will automatically use blob lease lock. nothing extra needed
where we do use that in locking mechanism in azure--------------->Navigate to your storage account in the Azure Portal.
Go to the Containers section and select the container that contains your blob.
Locate the specific blob and check its properties. If a lease is active, you will see lease information such as the lease state and lease duration.
within terraform how do you handle secret----------------->Store sensitive information in environment variables and reference them in your Terraform configuration. Mark input variables as sensitive to prevent them from being displayed in logs or output.
variable "db_password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
Use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve secrets securely.
how do you retrive the serect in azure
tell me the structure of terraform in your project
have you used count and for each in terraform------------>count for identical resource creation. for each() for various configuration of resources
probelms you faced during terraform deployment---------->State File Conflicts, Resource Already Exists, ncorrect or missing variable values can lead to interpolation errors.The Terraform state file is out of sync with the actual infrastructure
what is create before destroy in terraform----------->create_before_destroy
Purpose: By default, when Terraform needs to replace a resource, it first destroys the existing resource and then creates a new one. This can cause downtime. The create_before_destroy argument changes this behavior by creating the new resource first and then destroying the old one.
Usage: You can use the create_before_destroy argument within the lifecycle block of a resource definition.
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
Benefits:Minimizes Downtime: Ensures that the new resource is ready before the old one is destroyed, reducing service interruptions1.
Smooth Transitions: Useful for resources that need to maintain availability during updates or replacements.
why we use datablock in terraform------------->In Terraform, the data block is used to retrieve information about existing resources that are not managed by Terraform but are needed for your configuration
how do you import all the infra from cloud to terraform----------->we cannot import all resources at a time. we can only do 1 resource at a time
where did you use kv
what is msi and kv------------>msi for access of 1 resource to other. kv to store secrets and certs
types of networking in docker and how it works
how to reduce image size--------->Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Combine RUN Commands. Create a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the Docker build context. Install only the essential packages and libraries required for your application to run.
i have base image as 2.5 how to reduce it in docker----------->Use docker history <image_name> to examine the layers of your image. This will show you the size of each layer and the commands that created them. and followe above steps
why we use cmd and ENTRYPOINT. are there any dependencies on each other----------->they are not dependant on each other. If ENTRYPOINT is not defined, CMD specifies the executable to run.
diff types of msi. what is the difference between them-------------->system-Assigned Managed Identity
Description: This type of identity is tied directly to an Azure resource, such as a virtual machine or an App Service.
Lifecycle: The identity is created when the resource is created and is automatically deleted when the resource is deleted.
User-Assigned Managed Identity
Description: This type of identity is created as a standalone Azure resource and can be assigned to one or more Azure resources.
Lifecycle: The identity is managed independently of the resources that use it, allowing for more flexible and reusable identity management1
where you are deploying your app---------------->webapp
types of service bus and how will be sending messages----------->Azure Service Bus is used for reliable messaging between distributed applications. 1. Queues (Point-to-Point). one sender one receiver. 2. 2. Topics and Subscriptions (Publish-Subscribe). one sender multiple receivers

what are the types of metrics in azure monitoring-------------->CPU Usage (for VMs), Disk I/O (for VMs), Network Traffic (for VMs or load balancers), Request Count (for storage accounts),Response Time (from Application Insights), Failure Rate (from Application Insights), Server Response Time (from Azure App Services), Resource Utilization (e.g., VM memory, CPU), User Sign-ups per Hour
what are feeds in azure artifacts--------->they are like a package repositiries where you can host, share, manage your packages. it also control who can access the packages. it can host various packages types like nuget, npm, maven etc. it can be organizational or project based feeds.
what is ingress in k8-------------->Ingress is a Kubernetes object that manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
It acts as an entry point into your cluster — think of it like a reverse proxy or router that maps incoming requests to the appropriate backend services.
what is meamory leak------------->A memory leak is when a program allocates memory but fails to release it after it's no longer needed — causing memory usage to grow over time and eventually slow down or crash the system. eg when the object is not in use but still being refered then memory will take lot of time thus degrading the performance
why we use fork------------>when we want other persons repo to our repo then we use fork
why we use git stash------------->We use git stash to temporarily save your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) without committing them — so you can switch branches or pull updates without losing your work
how to optimize image in docker-------->use multi stage build, combine multiple run and cmd commands, install only the reuired dependencies, use .dockerignore file to remove unnecessary files. install the image from official website
why we use docker compose---------->We use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file. It’s when an app needs more than one service — like a web server, database, cache, etc.
what are the issues that you have faced while deploying pipelines----------->service connection not working, resources already exists, permission and authentication issues, resource quota issue, incorrect file path, yaml syntax issues, secrets being exposed, dependencies not installed, approval delays, pipeline not triggered from the mentioned branch, missing variables.
how do you define variables in powershell-------->$keyvault="keshavi". new-azkeyvault -Name $keyvault
what are self hosted and microsoft hosted agents in azure-------->microsoft agents are the agents that are maintained by azure. used for simple azure pipelines, we need to wait long time inorder to run our pipeline using this. less control. whereas self hosted agent has full control as it is prepared by us. used for complex pipelines. we dont have to wait for the pipelines to be run

Use ACR for Docker images and Helm charts.
how to create docker image
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smartek21:

tell me about yourself
the app is down as soon as you apply new patches. what steps you would take in such case---------->rollback to the previous version, check system logs, application logs, cpu crash, memory usage, diff between previous and new code, check any break in connection strings or secrets expired, test it again in test environment, include rollback or canary deployment, fix the issue, document the issue. if everyhting works fine then push the code to prod
what is the reactive and proactive methods for the above situation--------->Canary is a proactive strategy to safely test changes.
Rollback is a reactive strategy to recover from failed changes.
what are the development startegies while deploying to production------------>ci/cd pipeline, iac code, blue-green deployment(safe rollback), secret management, automated test cases, canary(fast rollback), rollback(no downtime, requires less infra than blue-green)

your team is growing from 5 to 50. how do you handle pipeline
you reduces 25% of vulnerabilities of security issues. what did u do------------->Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variables or identity-based access, 🔐 1. Introduced Automated Security Scanning using microsoft defender for cloud, Enforced branch protection rules & PR checks for security issues, setup microsoft defender to monitor and respond to alert faster. Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments, 
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example" {
  principal_id   = azurerm_azuread_service_principal.example.id
  role_definition_name = "Reader"  # You can replace this with other roles like Contributor, Owner, etc.
  scope           = azurerm_resource_group.example.id  # The scope can be a subscription, resource group, or resource.
}
for eg you are working in 3 tier architecuture. how do you combine multiple container ad how does it communicate with each other in docker---------->use docker compose for multi container app, use docker network for communicating between them

terraform using enterprise or standard version
do you maintain versions in terraform------------>azure repos
do you develop modules in terraform
what is statefile and why it is important------->The current state of all managed resources , Metadata about the resources. Without the state, Terraform would have to query every resource from the provider (e.g., AWS, Azure) on each run, which is slow and inefficient.
what if statefile is deleted and how do you recover it if you are using open source-------->cp terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate, use terraform import, take the previous version from azure blob

help me how to write a docker file to install tomcat server--------->
# Use the official Tomcat base image (includes Java)
FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk17
# Optional: Remove default web apps (like docs, examples, etc.)
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
# Optional: Copy your WAR file to the webapps directory
# COPY myapp.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
# Expose the default Tomcat port
EXPOSE 8080
how you expose port in docker--------->docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port> image_name
what is high availability. and how do you do that----------->
Strategy	                      Description
Redundancy	                    Duplicate systems/components (e.g., multiple VMs, servers, regions).
Load Balancing	                Distrib ute traffic across multiple instances to avoid overload.
Health Monitoring	              Detect and route around unhealthy instances.
Auto-Scaling	                  Automatically add/remove resources based on demand.
Failover	                      Automatically switch to backup systems when one fails.
Multiple Availability Zones	    Deploy across zones or regions to survive datacenter outages.
do you work on disaster recover---------->Infrastructure (cloud/on-premise/hybrid)
Applications (e.g., web apps, APIs, databases)
Data (backup strategies, RTO/RPO planning)
Cloud platforms (e.g., Azure Site Recovery, AWS Backup, GCP DR)------->Azure Site Recovery (ASR): Replicates VMs, physical servers, or other workloads to a secondary region.Azure Backup: For VM snapshots, SQL databases, file shares, etc.Zone-redundant services: Azure SQL, Storage, Kubernetes (AKS) support built-in redundancy.Geo-redundant storage (GRS): Automatically replicates to a paired region.Availability Zones & Sets: For high availability within a region.
Business continuity (failover/failback, high availability, geo-redundancy)
what is docker image------------->A Docker image is a read-only template that contains everything needed to run a Docker container, it has app code, dependencies, libraries, config file, os
what is docker container---------->A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. It contains the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime, which allows it to run consistently across different computing environments
i cant access vm. im getting timeout exception. what is the reason for that--------->enable ssh
what is security group---------->It acts as a set of rules that define which inbound and outbound traffic is allowed to or from an instance
on which port ssh run?-------->22. but we can also change the port number
commands that are there in linux
how are you managing access to multiple subscription----------->1. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
Azure AD Tenant, User & Group Management, Service Principals
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)-->Scope, roles
have you written automation scripts
how often you create ci/cd pipelines
what if build pipeline is broke
how to check if particular port is listening or not----------->netstat, curl,telnet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UHG:
when do we use load balancer. is it required? can we replace it with application gateway----------->LB (layer 4): You are distributing non-HTTP/S traffic, such as TCP/UDP, vm,vmss and containers, cost is low compared to other. app gateway is You are dealing with HTTP/HTTPS traffic (Layer 7), Web Application Firewall
how to restrict ip for a vm. if we have 100vm then how to do it--------->Place VMs in a subnet and apply NSG at the subnet level or If you need different rules for groups of VMs, define ASGs and use them in NSG rules. also instaed of givinf seperate ip adddress give range of ip's. we can also use azure firewall
have you worked on multi stage build
how to optimize the docker image
how to maintain security in docker
where do you store docker images---------->ACR
diff between docker run and docker start------------>Creates and starts a brand-new container from an image. docker start, Starts an existing, stopped container

what are some aws services
what is git rebase
branching strategies
how to solve git conflict
i manulay made changes in cloud. then how it will reflect in terraform
and how do you do vice version
how do you store secrets in terraform
why we use git cherrypick
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGGNE:
how do you resolve merge conflcits. if 100 persons made changes in same file then will you sit with 100 persons
explain how git cherrypick works. will it take upto that commitid or only that commitid--------------->git cherry-pick takes exactly one commit (the one you specify) and applies it to your current branch — not up to that commit, only that one
explain access policies in kv---------->An Access Policy is a rule that specifies: Who (a user, app, or service principal), Has access to what (secrets, keys, or certificates), And what permissions (e.g., get, list, set, delete)
im owner of sub will i get all the keys that are there in kv-------------->Owner role at subscription/resource group level can grant you access to the Key Vault, but does not itself grant access to secrets/keys inside the Key Vault. You must have a role like: Key Vault Secrets User to read secrets, Key Vault Reader (read vault metadata), Key Vault Administrator (full access)
what are the things we can achieve in azure active directory--------------> Register and manage enterprise applications and custom apps. Assign built-in or custom roles to users/groups to limit access. Manage and register devices. Self-service password reset. Self-service group management. Integration with Log Analytics, RBAC
diff between azure AD and windows service based directory--------->wad is for on premises access management. aad is for cloud access control, wad manages on premise device. aad manages cloud apps 
things that are there to create azure service connection--------->msi, service pricipal, azure resource manager, app id, tenant id, sub id, name of connection, 
Requirement	                        Description
Azure subscription	                Where resources will be deployed
Role in Azure	                      Owner or User Access Admin
Auth method	                        Auto SPN (recommended) or manual SPN
SPN info (manual only)	            Tenant ID, App ID, Secret
DevOps permission	                  Project Admin or allowed to manage service connections
RBAC permissions	                  Assign correct Azure roles to the SPN
Scope & name	                      Decide scope (sub/resource group) and clear naming
diff between system msi and user msi
give example for both msi----------->A single Azure VM accessing Key Vault. this is for system assigned identity
can we call other yaml file from pipeline---------> - template: templates/build-steps.yml
stages of your pipeline
how to use buildnumber as a variable in azure---------->Build.BuildNumber.   
steps:
    - script: echo "Build Number is $(myBuildNumber)"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Albertsons:

explain how you use docker artifcat and deploy it in webapp in ci/cd----------->store image in acr and download that image 
          - task: AzureWebAppContainer@1
            displayName: 'Deploy to Web App'
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: '<Your Service Connection Name>'
              appName: '<Your Web App Name>'
              containers: |
                $(containerRegistry)/$(imageName):$(Build.BuildId)
tools in ci/cd you are using
what is rg in azure
i want to use secrets in webapp
there is an app which is running outside. that app should get access to blob account and modify the data----------->The app must be registered in Azure AD.
Assign a role like Storage Blob Data Contributor to the app's service principal.
App must authenticate using client credentials flow (Client ID + Secret/Certificate).
can we achieve this using service principal------------->yes
how does the request goes to .net. how does the routing happen for any app
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Parentpay:

 write a powershell script where we send a email if the cpu usage is below 10
 how to make a module resuable accros systems n powershell---------->use modules. Import-Module MyModule Get-Command -Module MyModule
 adding multiple windows server in ansible to active directory domain. how to do it---------->add windows server in inventory file. use this inventory file in playbook. run the playbook
 how do we use active directory to optimize the login issues or authentication------->single sign on. sign in once and use all the other resources. by this loging to password is removed. use mfa so that password less is done. use mfa for security
 how to automate sql backup and restore and main data integrity---------->use checksum and dbcc checkdb to maintain integrity when taking backups
 write terraform script to deploy vm--------->rg, vnet,subnet,nic,nsg,storage,location, vm name, size, os
 how do you do sql patches
 how to you prioratize your task--------------> Prioritizing tasks effectively typically involves balancing urgency, importance, impact, and dependencies
 |                   | **Urgent**           | **Not Urgent**            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Important**     | Do immediately       | Schedule time to do       |
| **Not Important** | Delegate if possible | Eliminate or deprioritize |

 do you document everything
 did you automate any repeated task--------->yes added access policies and rbac roles to access the kv, keys, secrets and certs
 do you have any idea on kql------------>kusto query lang. used to check the azure monitor logs, log analytics, app insights
 any idea on iaas
 automate iaas how do you do that
 backup and restore things in azure cloud native tools------------>Azure Backup, SQL Database Backup and Restore, Azure Blob Storage Backup, Azure Site Recovery

Carelon L2:

where are you hosting your applications---------------->on webapp hosted on vm
tell me pipeline which you have build and how you are deploying your code to vm
are you familiar with k8
what is diff between terraform plan and init-------------->Initializes a Terraform working directory, installs plugins, Sets up the backend. plan: Shows what changes Terraform would make, Compares current state with desired config in .tf files, Does not make any actual changes
how do you modify the statefile-------------->Modifying a Terraform state file is generally not recommended because it can lead to inconsistencies and potentially break the infrastructure if not done carefully. terraform state rm to remove resource, terraform state mv to move resource, terraform state push/pull 
i have a vm. in my next plan we have to stop destroying the vm. how to do that----------->prevent_destroy = true in lifecycle block
how do you execute the terraform modules
in your pipeline have to incorporated any security stages--------->yes we use microsoftsecuritydevops task for scanning, checking secrets exposed, dependecny scan and container scan

i have 4env and all these env should be triggered from only 1pipeline----------->give diff stages and their service connections
i want to deploy on dev using only 1branch. whats the condition you use for the dev stage to trigger the code only from 1branch----------->condition:eq(variables['build.sourcebarnchname']. 'keshavi')
have you integrated your code with sonarcube
you are advised to provision the db and that dv should be accesed by internal people only and app should be accessed by other users. how to do that--------->use NSG. if you want adavnced features then use ASG
my app is in other vnet and db is on other vnet. how do you make a connection between them------------>vnet Peering
i dont want my secerts and cert to be exposed in pipelne. how to do it
did u create group rbac policies in microsoft entra id
i have a project dependency on other company how do you link both the projects in aad---------->invite external user from entra id and give respective roles and access.(B2B)
how do you handle tickets
how to do track the build failure
how do you segregate if the issue is from develpment team or operation teams--------->API,functionality, configuration, response time, app code issues means dev 
you are doing prod deployment it got 60% completed and got failed how do you handle this situation
i dont want all persons to access my repos or file. how do you secure your repo-------------->we can add branch policies, or in repo settings we can restrict others to access(read,write). even the org settings we can give access to specific users
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cognizant L2:

tell me about yourself and have you handled any escallations
what are your achievements
what are services you have worked on infra side
few dev are wokring on github. how the changes are going to reflect in remote or main barnch. what are the steps will be done
what is the connection between ado and github------->tell them about the git intergration with ado
how to make service connections
now connection has been made, now i want to create a pipeline once the changes came to main. tell me how to trigger and test cases in pipeline
how ado interacts with azure resources
how terraform is given in ci/cd pipeline
give me the modules and steps for terraform infra deployment--------->use terraform task in pipeline
if we get 401 error. how you will resolve that issue. what may be the cause of this----------->Incorrect username/password or API key,OAuth token expired or revoked, Client not authorized for the requested resource,For example, user lacks permission.Incorrect authentication method
suppose any policy is restricting. how you will rectify it--------->give access policies for user in kv
give me an example of fucntional app
lets say you are working for clinet. he told to deploy resources and u have done all the coding. but when you are about to deploy the client says this is not what they have given and asked us to change the code. what will you do in that scenario.--------->compare the previous doc and op to your code
and also when you are about to deploy client is not there. so with whom you will take the apporval and what is the process for that as you cannot postpone the deployment window
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wipro:

tell me format of yaml
why we are using ansible for automation instead of powershell------------>Ansible uses YAML playbooks, which are easy to read and maintain, PowerShell is a full scripting language — powerful but can become complex quickly.
why terraform not other iac Tools
i dont want all persons to access my repos or file. how do you secure your repo------->project settings-->permissions-->reader/contributor-->user add
If anyone make changes in any file in ado I should get notification in ado------>projct settings-->notifications-->pr changes----->subscription
What are endpoints in azure------->An endpoint is a URL, IP address, or DNS name (possibly with a port) that exposes a service to be accessed over a network — either publicly or privately. public is available over internet. private is acceseble thorugh vnet. service end point extends vnet to azure resources like sa. Used to secure services to only be accessible from your VNet.

Corelogic L1:

what is devops and whats the role of it
describe how you learn new things
if the technology is not there in google then how you learn them
describe how you interact with dev team in your project
when there is no documentation for the internal tools then how you learn them
how do you maintain documentation -------------->first document the project preview, next give dependencies and links for that. give the contact person names. give them repo details, ci/cd pipeline links, example of terraform and screenshots of output, add error details and how we have resolved them. 
explain ci/cd pipeline you have created
what are build, release and azure artifacts--------->build artifact is produced at ci process. release artifact uses the build artifact and consumes them and deploy it. azure artifact acts as a storage system where we can store the artifacts
if you faced any issues in prod how you resolve them------->if there are any issues in prod will create a branch called hotfix and test it locally and raise pr and merge and push to prod
are you interested only code deployment or also interested in infra deployment
when it comes to automation, have you got any chace to work on bash or python
tell me the braching strategy. if something goes wrong in prod how you rectify them. and you will merge them---------->if there are any issues in prod will create a branch called hotfix and test it locally and raise pr and merge and push to prod
how you will know when to merge the code-------->Code is complete and meets the acceptance criteria, All unit/integration tests pass, Pull Request (PR) is approved by reviewers
did you write terrafrom code from scratch
what your thoughts to rewrite the code in terraform------->use modules, tfvars file, varibale.tf file
diff ways to pass variables in terraform--------->use variables.tf files, use dev.tfvars file, use it at applying  terraform apply -var="region=westeurope" -var="env=prod"
how to pass variables in run time in terraform-------->terraform apply -var="region=westeurope" -var="env=prod"   terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
lifecycle in terraform. where do you need create_before_destroy------->lifecycle has create_before_destroy, prevent_destroy, ignore_changes, precondition
do you package your .net code as docker image?
what is the build tool you are using in your project
are you using docker swarm? how do you run your containers
diff types of docker networks
if we dont have technolgies in our project then how you will learn new ones
what are the open source monitoring tools you have learned that are not there in your project
how are you detecting the issues in prod using monitoring tools
how do you differentiate between dev probelm or infra probelm------------>API,functionality, configuration, response time, app code issues means dev.use app insights for app related issues.use log analytics for infra related issue it is infra, cpu, memory, permission, service connection means infra issue
apart from .net have you deployed any other code
are you comfortable in writing jenkins groovy scripts
what is difference between build pipeline and artifact----->build pipeline builds, packages, install, test the code. but artifact is like a zip file which has all the properties, packages, dependencies which are used to run your apps
are there any cost constraints between build pipeline and artifacts--------->yes, in build we have agents(self/microsoft) and also artifacts ha storage which will be free for particular limit
advantages and disadvantages of using yaml------->can write both ci/cd in single file. can define multiple task, easily readable. can get more syntax error, hard to debug
what is diff between blue-green deployment and canary deployment
what is the advantages and disadvantages of both deployments-------->blue-green zero downtime, instant rollback. canary cost-efficient as we dont need double infra, will get feedback quickly
have you deployed dotnet framworks on docker contianers
how do you ensure code quality in your pipeline--------->we use microsoft defender for cloud to do all the security checks. iac scanning for validating iac against security policy. secret scanning to check the secrets are being exposed. dependency scanning i.e., synk. Identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and suggests fixes
how do you ensure the app is available to customers--------->vmss, availablity zone, autoscaling, deployment strategies(blue-green), continous monitoring, disaster recovery methods.

considerations you take care when deploying to production release----------->Code Quality: Ensure all code has passed automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end).
Approvals: Use manual or automated approvals (e.g., from QA, product owners).
Security Scans: Run static and dynamic security analysis (SAST/DAST).
Dependency Checks: Verify third-party libraries are up-to-date and secure.
take backup, infra health check, deployment strategy, rollback plan, monitoring the alerts
